binance,ios,James4all,5,2023-10-04 08:23:28,How can someone set stop lose and take profit Binance won’t close the market when it reach stop lose they will allow the market to liquidate you. Then what is the reason of giving your customers such options if is not working. I wake up today with a very sad mood. Because I set up a stop lose on my future trades and wake up this morning that they didn’t close the market for when the stop lose reach until I was liquidated and lost all my money. It’s better not to give us such options so we can monitor our trades by ourselves since you can’t close market with stop lose or take profit until the person lose all his money.
binance,ios,Zionsb,1,2023-05-24 00:13:10,"I have been using Binance for a little bit, even promoting it on my website. I made a serious purchase a couple months ago of about 2-3 Bitcoin, about $50k, along with my partner who also spent about 50k, so 6 figures total. When the transaction was made, the money was transferred out of our bank accounts, but no Bitcoin was added to the wallet. We waited 3-4 days for the transaction to go through and nothing. We started contacting and found out that our money was sent, but our Bitcoin was being withheld for no reason. There was no reason this should’ve happened since we bought it through the app especially for longer than a week . We were communication with a middle man for months trying to figure out why our Bitcoin was not being sent to us and all we got were excuses saying they were trying their best and that we were being rude. We stopped using Binance on our website and they got upset with us saying that it was unnecessary and that they don’t understand why we would stop using their services. Been about 6 months and still no word. Our money is long gone and if you use this app to purchase more than a couple hundred dollars worth of tokens, they will take your money as well."
binance,ios,Username: Courtney,2,2021-04-11 18:25:51,"The only thing good about the app is it’s interface. If I didn’t have this one problem I would be obsessed with the app. The customer support is basically non existent. You have to submit a ticket if you have an issue, but don’t express a response. I’ve attempted over 300 times to purchase crypto directly and deposit money to my account, and only TWO times did I find success. I was allowed two times to purchase crypto directly from my linked bank account. I’ve deleted and add my bank 100 times, that doesn’t work. I’ve submitted multiple tickets. No response. I’m transferring the very little crypto I was allowed to purchase to a wallet and I’m switching over to another app.

It’s very upsetting because the app offers a variety of crypto and low fees. The only thing I can’t do is purchase the crypto. It seems like a lot of people have this problem so I wonder how they even make money. My recommendation: get a better customer support, or fix the issue that everyone seems to be having"
binance,ios,joshdammit,1,2023-06-15 10:57:52,"Got an email last week saying binance is shutting down USD withdrawals due to the SEC suing them. We have until the 13th to get our withdrawals in. I deposited my ADA from a wallet and sold it on the 9th. Received my confirmation email immediately and clicked the link on it. “Pending” for several days.

This morning, it’s listed as “failed.” It’s now past their cutoff date and I have nearly $500 stuck in their account. I reached out to chat several days ago to confirm the withdrawal was going to be okay and was told there’d be a high wait time and I’d get a notification on my phone when an agent was available. I never got anything until early, early, early this morning while I’m asleep I get an email notifying me an agent has been trying to reach me. They closed the chat. Still no notifications, they just left me in the dark all weekend while they ran the clock so they wouldn’t have to give me my money.

Binance is a scam operation and they deserve whatever lawsuits come their way."
binance,ios,King Banks M,1,2021-05-05 17:13:25,"I’ve been trying to buy crypto for a while now I created my account and sent personal verification and I’ve been waiting literally weeks for this to be verified. I had a few crypto stocks I wanted to add huge investments to but could not even buy them due to my account not being verified, I tried to contact customer support and they have an automatic set up you can’t contact them through email, and filing a ticket doesn’t even matter because they won’t get back to you. To top it off they do not have a phone number to talk to an actually person, if you use the app and have this same issue, I’d advise not to call any of the number google or the random websites say is Binance’s phone number they’re obvious scams. I deactivated my account and deleted the app and told my friends about my experience if I get a response back describing my situation to help me understand what happen along with a phone number or actually non-automatic email I’ll change the review."
binance,ios,Jay T 2402,4,2021-11-16 14:47:55,"Unfortunately the mobile app has recently changed regarding the drawing of trend lines. This app was absolutely fantastic to draw trends, change past drawn lines and being able to see approximately the date of intersecting trends. There was no announcement of the update/changes and I want Binance to read this feedback so as to change things back to what they were. The app was a well deserved 5 star rating but now it is not as helpful as it was. 
Even on stochastic indicators, trend lines and cursor could be dragged over to see values of RSI, KDJ and so on easily, user-friendly like no other app. 

Kindly correct this easy step to assist the functionality of your trading app and provide your customers with an experience that can’t be beaten by your competitors. Thank you"
binance,ios,Tammmmmmz,1,2021-06-17 03:22:32,"When markets move in a favorable direction many users reported their accounts locked. Check Twitter for details of customers begging to get their accounts unlocked. I’ve been a Binance customer since 2017, already authenticated, and verified multiple times. My account was locked  from February through May 2021 on both Binance and Binance US. Magically, my accounts were unlocked after market took a steep dive. Binance, virtually offers no customer support, no phone to call, no follow up email. You will only get an acknowledgment email to confirm that customer support received your complaints.  I tried hundreds of times without a response. I moved to my accounts their main competitor. FTC needs to jump in and regulate.

Check the reviews, too many users have similar experience. Binance uses our Crypto to trade for their own benefit, could explain locked accounts. Cheats. Doesn’t make sense this app received more than 2 stars review."
binance,ios,cmj141,4,2020-06-07 21:21:03,"The exchanges GUI is cluttered. I end up touching something I didn’t mean to touch because all the buttons are close to each other. I understand they want this to be user friendly by placing everything in the open so nothing is hidden but it just makes everything messy. Add menus and you can free up space on the GUI. It’s hard increasing and decreasing price of coins we are selling in the exchange without hitting something else and causing the screen to swipe. Same goes for the amount buttons to increase and decrease the amount of coins we are selling and buying in the exchange screen. 

Also id like to be able to see market/price history on the buy/sell screen so I can see how much a coin was being sold for last month as I’m pricing it for selling without having to change screens and go to the other market tab to engage prices. 

Oh and most importantly there should be a note when selling coins that there’s a bare minimum of .1 before we go to sell our coins. I wasted time setting up a coin to sell just to find out afterwards I didn’t have enough coins to sell which wasted minutes of my time. So minimums and other rules should be made visible at all times. 

Other than that it’s a good app. 4 stars."
binance,ios,Ceejay ijeh,5,2023-05-15 23:53:07,"This is the 4th time, you give the buyer over estimated time, after the time is up for investigation, you haven’t cancelled trade. I have sent 6 proofs and videos to show the buyer is not cooperating or communicating, the buyer hasn’t sent a single proof and Binance is still yet to cancel trade. You should stick to your rules. Once the time is up for both parties , you cancel, this started this year. Last year wasn’t like this. I’m a very upset customer. I have been awake from 4pm till now 1 am waiting for the trade to be cancelled and nothing from buyer or Binance. Please look into my appeal now"
binance,ios,Lovesmuggler,1,2020-02-04 17:08:37,"In 2018 I opened a Binance account, and to this day they will not let me withdraw money from it.  Every time I complete some task to verify who I am, they come up with another one.  Tell me the IP you first logged in from in 2018 and the date.  Send us an ID pic.  Oh not that one a different kind.  Oh not that one it’s dirty.  Now we are to the point they are asking me for multiple IDs, and recording a VIDEO of myself showing the date and IDs and myself logged into the page and they STILL are responding back saying things like “oh you didn’t say this right” and “you need to also video your withdrawal history” (which doesn’t exist because they won’t let me withdraw”.  This site is not safe to use for people on the US, they are justifying keeping my withdrawal functions turned off because I’m in the US, but they were happy to let me deposit money.  PLEASE save yourself the frustration and don’t put money into this site it’s possible you will never retrieve it."
binance,ios,Comander fox,4,2021-08-14 06:39:35,"I love binance for buying/selling crypto. However, a couple updates back i noticed a sudden change in performance when you enter trade charts, open the buy/sell menu, and leave trading charts in particular where the app consistently stalls for a one or two second period before the action is carried out. This used to not happen and makes it difficult to quickly switch between trades and buy or sell on mobile. These used to happen almost instantly. It would be really helpful if this delay could be sorted out. I’ve had to resort to the website for these actions because this delay makes quick trading decisions impossible during busy market movements."
binance,ios,NANOBIN,5,2021-08-12 06:20:19,"Being the largest crypto exchange platform while having the WORST customer support team with horrifying experience. I am a legacy user since 2018, and the account is restricted with several thousand dollar in it. Contacted support three times, each time transferred to a “specialist” with no follow up at all. Submitted ticket, with no avail and no real person attends to the case. Seems like luring you in and not allowing you to withdraw is their business model. Run away from this hypocritical service as fast as you can, or find a better alternative."
binance,ios,Aznttboy,1,2021-05-26 08:29:50,"Cryptocurrencies might be Binance’s game, they might actually be fairly good at it (have yet to get hacked to the point of shutting down; owner have not run off with investors crypto assets). But the entire registration and verification process is broken as F___! And from the family and friends that told me their personal experiences about Binance, I can keep trying (to infinity) or give up.  Binance is that bad, at least with ID verification and proof of address, etc.  the advice is to keep trying, uploading the same PDF document and with any luck, 6 months later, it will magically get approved.

I supposed it could be a Robinhood app, and Binance will disrupt trading, force liquidate positions, just because they are undercapitalized and think they can do it without legal and civil ramifications. 

Oh, the Binance mobile app and their website can’t agree on my login credentials either. At first I thought I downloaded the wrong app and my login is actually being sent to the database of a phishing con artist. Luckily it is just horrible UI, flawed end user usability issue, that even a novice Software QA tester can identify and document for a high priority bug fix report.

1 star, because 0.5 star or lower is not an option."
binance,ios,Kingjoses,1,2021-05-15 03:09:56,I don’t understand how this company became one of the biggest crypto platforms this company is terrible the verification process is almost impossible face scan and ID don’t work customer service is nonexistent absolutely terrible I tried over 20 times to get verified and every time it says ID not supported which makes no sense and anytime you try to contact customer service you get no help they even penalized for trying to ask for help to many times i’m just trying to figure out how to delete my account from this garbage app so they don’t keep my information they also ask you for so much personal information more then any other crypto platforms in the United States so it makes no sense how it take this long for people to get verified garbage company don’t waste your time use coinbase or coinbase  pro

Only complaint. I took part in the launch of the GOAL token when it launched and lost my entire capital in less than 5 mins of it launching. Kept my money in but it never grew pass 20 dollars even though my initial investment was 100. It went from 100 to 2 dollars in seconds then back to 20 and never recovered.

binance,ios,king afghanistan,5,2024-05-10 04:23:38,"1. Wide range of cryptocurrencies: Binance offers a vast selection of cryptocurrencies to trade, including some lesser-known and newer coins.

2 Competitive fees: Binance's fees are generally lower than many other cryptocurrency exchanges, making it an affordable option for traders.

3. High liquidity: Due to its large user base and extensive trading volumes, Binance has high liquidity, which allows for faster and more efficient trading.

Yes I use Yubikey on the desktop app...so a little bit of help explaining what to do about it would be helpful. I see others are having the same issue, yet Binance who needs to learn about customer service and UX/UI design need to get their act together!

I gave up and went to Bitrue which is a much better experience on desktop and mobile. Unfortunately some altcoins don’t trade on Bitrue, and I trade mostly on my phone as I’m always on the go. So Binance...get your act together because sooner rather than later more traders will find other exchanges that have a good customer support and user interface than what you are offering now!!!"

Figured it was safe, and didnt know binance couldn’t be used in the US anymore. They told me to withdraw my funds, but then when I tried to withdraw they actually blocked my transfer. Then told me I needed to verify, which I already did with my ID in order to get into my account. So now they are telling me in order to withdraw my funds I must verify, but won’t let me verify, because it asks for your country of origin and US isn’t even an option. So I can’t even do what they’re telling me I need to do in order to get my crypto out! Nobody replies back for the help chat or email. They’ll rob you if they get the chance. Do not use Binance!!"

I should go outside and risk my life taking a video of my phone with another phone showing how I am going to log in to my bank ok what if I didn't have another phone but I then used my girlfriend photos for the task but after everything it was all a waste of time and the money was for the completion of my rent, till now I have not been able to retrieve my money.

When it comes to crypto trading I would only Prefer Binance. The most amazing thing about Binance is their TradingBots which are incredible, but still needs some refinements. Such as Bots should have TP and SL to minimise risk and maximise profits. With such improvements Bots would be more profitable. They should also add other AI based Bots to Automatically trades based on current market Situations. Please Pay attention to Bots ."
binance,ios,Mamah Collins,4,2023-10-08 05:10:44,"Hi, very wonderful app you got here. I enjoy every moment working with it, not every moment, but most of it. Please, and please I will love it if you guys can modify a setting that deactivate buyers who aren’t available/online to trade/buy assets, at least until they are back online. Sometimes, we need to make urgent trades, but when buyers are not available it ruins a lot of things for us, hence we have to wait till the trade is cancelled before we can move forward with a different trader, and that’s a long time. 
Thank you very much. 
Keep up the good work."
binance,ios,Bazcas,1,2022-04-06 17:16:26,"The reviews advising of all the trouble receiving MFA codes, text, email, and Authenticator apps are spot on. It is an absolute nightmare trying to do anything but buy on this platform. Text never show, Authenticator app codes timeout pending no show emails and texts, resend options lock for a minute each time when nothing has been sent. It’s almost like it’s built into the platform to do this because the struggles are literally the same total timeframe each and every day tested. You can actually map it from day to day and the total time and “loop” it sends you in trying to withdraw funds is the same every day. This platform is very bad, and I’d recommend going somewhere else for crypto exchange."
binance,ios,upin347,5,2022-06-29 09:07:28,"I think Binance is a very efficient and easy to understand trader's place, because there are pro and non-pro modes. In addition, there are many features that other exchanges don't have such as futures contracts, margin, staking, NFT, p2p and many others. On the security side, Binance has also done well by adding Face ID and 2FA to secure your account. Moreover, there are many interesting events that Binance often conducts such as competition trading. This makes binance suitable for people all over the world."

The exchange window is extremely glitchy now, always freezes, will display BTC/USDT order book when I am trying to see another coin, will not refresh pages smoothly if it even refreshes at all, crashes often... it just isn’t as reliable anymore. The isolated margin actions such as borrow, repay, and transfer are glitchy as well. Non-executed orders don’t show up like they used to now, requires ~5 refresh attempts now. I used to rely on the app when the website slowed down, but now I can’t trust it. Please fix back to the way it was."
binance,ios,TheLukeShort,1,2021-09-30 08:31:38,"I was one of Binance’s first customers in 2017

I’ve held BNB since it was less than $1 and still hold it. 

Well now that CZ is kicking us off after giving in to supporting all that goes against crypto, I no longer can use it even with a VPN. 

So I temporarily went over to Binance U.S. but they stole $50,000 from me the first month I was there a year ago and never gave it back because they messed up my KYC. 

They stole $96,000 from another friend that nearly bankrupt him right when he had his first child.

They stole around $20k from another friend who attempted to self harm himself when he couldn’t get help to get his life savings back. 

It’s wrong. 

Then CZ allows Brian Brooks, a criminal, to run Binance U.S. like this with no customer service or care for people’s lives.

The person on Twitter said they were fixing it this time and making special effort to get it right 47 times! And they never remembered me after each time. 

I never got my money back, but bad things are coming for the entire Binance name, so stay far away or you’ll likely end up like me and my friends."

Yeah,  one can know the P/L per day but it would be nice to see an average cost per position as well as the portfolio P/L. For instance, if I keep buying ETH, I would like to see how much I paid on average for each ETH and how much is the P/L vs that average cost.

It’s been 3 months since I’ve created the account and they cannot verify me. Come to find out they’ve removed the option to deactivate your account only leaving the disable(pause) option. When you reach out to customer service it’s a continuous loop redirecting you to “how to disable” instructions. The worst part about all this is that they claim the right to retain all of your private information for 6 years after deactivation. They’re robot email states that in their reply but yet they don’t help you deactivate. Avoid this platform at all cost.

They stated that I didn’t need to verify if I was only withdrawing, which was my intention. However my account was purposely locked, so they can take my assets hostage to force me to accept the biometric data collection. On top of that when asking them to delete your account and data, which is your right, they play dumb saying you cannot and make you jump through hoops to get it done. Very shady business practices, go use a platform with better customer service."

I tried to complete my registration to Binance site but at the end I found that My country (Iraq) is not listed and some kind of ban for Iraq and some countries,, 
With respect to your regulation but seems no sense to put few countries in like this list , because if there is a law or regulations or ban should applicate for any kind of illegal financial transection or political issues should be done for many and many other countries accepted already for registration in your site,  that we know they are the way for illegal world money transfer and money laundry.
 plus all operations normally under control by you and the international government (if I understood your site policy well).
So please review this point very well and under the rights of using internet and its applications I would like to ask you kindly to explain your reasons to put a ban on my country and other five or six countries.

Wish my email will have your high consideration.

Best Regards."

What’s the point of that??? By that point I already don’t want the stock and I’m likely to lose money. 

Hey binance. How about you give us the price of the stock we had at the time of purchase numbnuts. Frustrating. I hate this app."

- turn off email marketing
- change account settings or remove linked financial information
- close the account

What happened to having SEPA enabled accounts in places like Germany and Estonia for God sakes where they have better crypto knowledge. Coinbase is using Estonia what’s really happening to the team in charge of payment. Are they thinking as fast as they paid

It is an integral part of daily financial transactions for many people, and a lot of users rely on bKash. I hope Binance will consider adding direct deposit and withdrawal options via bKash on its platform. This integration would be incredibly convenient for Bangladeshi users and would support Binance’s growth in the region. Thank you!"""

(see youtube please for further assistance). I am also afraid of that. binance should do the transfer directly in bank account without involving anyone in between and for the trader to be safe. thanks for reading my review

binance,android,lnstaII [ CASHPIRATE ] App to Earn,5,2025-04-04 22:45:26,"Mind blowing platform. With its quick response and seamless controls, Binance is an excellent tool for cryptocurrency trading. Because the trading campaigns are brief, they are perfect for brief sessions. Even for novices, the Ul is easy to use. Pay-to-win features, however, might be annoying because certain characters and skins offer benefits. The exchange doesn't always react right away and occasionally appears to have its own ecology. The skill Component may be diminished."

In my country the first ID is received at 14 years old. With this in mind your app ads target all people age not just above this secment. If it is not your fault it is an IARC mistake and I will report this to higher authority like European Consumer Protection.

coinbase,ios,dank0116,5,2021-10-11 01:28:16,I am impressed by how easy this app is to use.  There is endless amounts of information about cryptocurrency on Coinbase and if it is t there u can be connected to it.  I had been weary about crypto but when I heard about Coinbase I was originally in getting shares of it when it went public.  When I was unable to get the stock and it went through the roof right off like had figured we’ll that is when I decided to download and check it out.  Coinbase gave me a small amount for down loading the app and then through the learn and earn feature I was able to learn what crypto is and does but also get like four different currencies.  The ease of operation of the app made it very i intimidating and I continued to learn about crypto amd now I’m trading almost daily.  I also had some support issues with my Coinbase card and they were quickly replied to and I was given some basic help which was unable to solve the problem but they sent my issue up the support chain and my Coinbase card was fully operational the next morning.  I say thank you to Coinbase for making it easy for me to learn and operate trading with crypto currency’s because it has been easy making money.
coinbase,ios,Stevenra14,4,2025-01-23 03:06:29,"Really good app for crypto beginners and intermediate users. But I wish the integration of Coinbase advanced/basic side was better. One example is the alerts, why can’t I just set custom price alerts while on Coinbase advanced? That would save a lot of time. Same thing with checking my staking rewards and coins, why can’t I check these in advanced also? I have to switch advanced off to do these things. It really should be on both sides of the app. One real big complaint I have and issue I have found many other people have is the ability to link your bank account without using plaid. This is a big red flag for me. It used to work very long ago but at some point was made basically useless. The manual linking will still show up but it never actually works. No matter what bank you have. Coinbase support will just push you to use plaid which is just very weird when linking a bank account manually is the industry standard. This also is the case on desktop, not just the app. I do not want to use plaid and give my bank login to a third party regardless of how safe you guys say it is. Other than these three things I mentioned the app is nice, clean and works well. But I really wish these updates/fixes were implemented. Appreciate all the effort you guys put in, keep up the good work!"
coinbase,ios,Robinhoodallday,1,2024-10-22 02:53:25,"I use Coinbase for about three years and was happy with their service until halfway through this year. I don’t know what has changed with it. They’ve just got enough customers that they feel they don’t need to worry about how they treat individuals I guess I would say. I signed up for the Coinbase one membership to get rid of all the hydrating fees they charge and it does help though they’re still hidden fees every time we buy trading something in the “spread” so be aware of that even though it says zero fees are still paying $.10-$.50 per trade.  They may randomly just lock your account with no explanation and then if you ask for a refund on anything and your account locked, never funded and crypto so it’s still locked. They still have your money so they never give your money back. I have currently been locked out of my account since the day before my birthday so about two weeks now I have spent roughly 8 hours on the phone with Customer Service to try to find out why I get the same party line every time that the system didn’t like something OK so go in and freaking change it that’s why you have humans working there, but on the upside, that’s how I discovered using Robin Hood much cheaper much more friendly service much quicker and easier. I recommend Robin Hood because between the SEC against Coinbase and they’re treating their users. I just don’t see a bright future form. I’m currently with what they have basically stolen my money."
coinbase,ios,CPG Tiberius,1,2024-11-11 20:08:17,"It is absolutely mind boggling how unhelpful and circular their customer support is. There is no email link to create a ticket for resolving issues, instead they default to a chat bot that references sources to the same circular solutions. Solutions that do not work. I have been bouncing around the website trying to troubleshoot my issue (I’m trying to update my phone number) and there is not a single piece of reference material for me to do this that actually works. In my account through the browser, I can see an option to update my number. When I select it, it wants me to verify my account. How does it want me to verify? Through SMS. I don’t have that number. I select try another way and when I provide my email it just logs me back into my account right where I started. There is no where for me to send an email to speak with someone and there are no representatives that I can physically call. This is THE LARGEST crypto trading app and they are making hundreds of millions of dollars on trades. How can they not afford customer support or even an email for me to create a ticket? It’s absolute insanity. I need my number updated because my account automatically removed my bank when signing in on a new device and I have 40k just sitting there and I can’t do anything about it. I can’t imagine a banking service having absolutely zero customer support. I would stop banking with them immediately. Unfortunately my funds are locked or I would stop using Coinbase."
coinbase,ios,Vanzator,1,2024-07-04 01:42:30,"Story goes like this, I’m using coinbase everyday, checking prices and buying whatever I find as a good deal. Strangely today I get unlogged next step I’m trying to get back into the account. Here comes the coinbase support which I would rate as 0. I do not have the phone number from Denmark which I had and I didn’t put up to date, my fault, I admit, but on the other side coinbase it’s asking for my id or my driver license to get my account back, after 10 attempts (at least 10 let’s make it 20) finally tired of doing it I’m trying to get in touch with a live agent, in this case if you want to talk with a live agent thru text you have to be logged in(how can I do that in my case!!!), then I’m trying to call them, pressing the buttons to direct me, the robot tells me that I need to get to the coinbase page in order to obtain my account back I have to send pictures with my id or driver license and to film me while I spoke my code(back and forth doing the same thing I did at first). Now the last time I’m trying and they blocked me for too many attempts. Congratulations Coinbase, why in the earth it’s so difficult to get my account back while I’m sending you videos with myself doing exactly what you told me. It’s just driving me crazy, no email to reach you, no phone number, how am I supposed to get my account back? 
Am I going to get a response on this platform at least? Or is it going to be ignored like all my other attempts 🙂"
coinbase,ios,caseyishappy,1,2022-08-12 00:19:12,"On November 25th I tried to transfer my btc to another wallet and I was told the transaction would be on hold due to security reasons and I had to upload my ID. It wouldn’t let me so I let it go and waited the 3 days it said it would take. Well flash forward 5 days, I had completely forgotten about it and hurried to check both accounts and my email since I know I never received it. Somehow the account I had tried to transfer it to said I received the btc on November 23rd which would’ve been impossible. I tried to contact support for both accounts and got a couple of unhelpful, “it was deposited,” replies. Flash forward again to tax season and I had my tax documents from both account that say the $500 was deposited on the 23rd but Coinbase transferred it on the 26th. I showed them that and showed the other account I haven’t even been able to spend $500 to reach the $0 I was at so the math doesn’t add up either but not even an apology was given from either companies. I saw someone else review Coinbase with the same exact issue a few days after me so I’m sure Coinbase knows their system messed up in November but don’t care. I had put $500 in Coinbase for emergencies and I was kicked out of my apartment after a medical emergency so I was in an double emergency and Coinbase made it a triple emergency and cost me a roof over my head for the mistakes they don’t seem to acknowledge. I don’t even know how many emergencies that all comes out to now."
coinbase,ios,Mbev0391,1,2022-01-31 21:22:16,"I’ve had this app for a while now to do simple investing. Recently, I decided to get into NFTs and wanted to transfer crypto into its compatible wallet. When doing so, I was sent an email saying that I needed to verify my ID, and if I didn’t, there would be a 72 hour delay. I verified my ID and received a message saying that verification was successful. After 20-30 minutes of waiting for my wallet to populate with my crypto, the balance still said $0. I sent it to the correct wallet address before anyone asks. I reached out to their support team just to be have the conversation end abruptly by the agent. So the next morning, I message again to ask where it is. This was a Saturday. He then told me that it will be in my wallet on Sunday. Sunday rolls around, and it’s not there. I contact them AGAIN and the agent tells me she sees it’s being worked on and there’s a 72 hour delay. I explained i did the ID verification successfully and there shouldn’t be a delay. She said “that’s the protocol” and ended the conversation thread!!! I contact them TODAY (Monday) and they can’t give me any answers or a timeline. I needed the crypto today for a mint on an NFT and now I’ve missed out on several thousand dollars because of this poor way of Coinbase doing things. This is unacceptable especially when people are trying to make money through your platform!!! There are other platforms out there so it would be beneficial if you search elsewhere."
coinbase,ios,Cova13,1,2022-01-04 01:40:46,"So this is my first app that I used for investing, had my hopes up but the customer service really brought down my motivation for using this app. Honestly i regret downloading it. Once I had downloaded the app I went through the whole process to be able to start buying and selling but once I tried buying through my chase account that I had already linked and yes I did everything exactly how the app demanded it, but it still wouldn’t let me buy because of suspicious activity. So I contact their help support, after telling the bot to put me in contact with a person since the bot was not being helpful at all. Turns out theirs nobody you can call it’s all through text and once I explain my problem he would just tell me to put my id and a pic which I already had done so I re-did the process and still nothing change I kept telling him that but he would keep sending me the same message about putting my id and pic it almost seem like he was just sending me texts he had save in his system. So once he finally realize that his way wasn’t working he send my problem to be check by someone else where I got an email saying that they where checking my account and around six days they would get back to me I open up my email today and I see an email from them saying that they close my case without even fixing nothing. I have to give it to them they really know how to frustrate someone"
coinbase,ios,Zeus Monkey,1,2023-02-09 00:42:19,"I had Coinbase loaded onto my phone since early 2020. As of last week, they updated it and it requires an iOS of 14.0. I have gotten the most recent update of my iOS to 12.5.7, so the app will not work on my phone. I thought, OK, I’ll just go to the website. Nope. Cannot sign on there. There’s no place to sign in on the website. I tried sending an email by clicking the “Contact Us” link. It doesn’t work. None of the options work. I did a Google search for a Coinbase email address for support, and found a couple. One worked but said they no longer responded to emails, and directed me to click a link. That link took me back to the same previous “Contact Us” page where nothing works. There is no way to contact them about not being able to access the app or site. Pitiful customer service.

 I’m glad I never invested with Coinbase. The cryptocurrencies I received there were earned by doing the tasks required to get free crypto. I was testing it out to see how it would go. My crypto grew slowly to nearly $60, but then the bottom dropped out of sight. The last time I was able to check, my crypto was only worth about $8, where it had been hovering for a while. The $5 in Bitcoin I’d received was only worth about $1.50. I wouldn’t trust cryptocurrencies, not any more than I trust Coinbase... which is not at all. It won’t let me put in a “ZERO” choice of stars, so one it is."

As a consumer alone in the crypto jungle i am sometimes saddened by the limits of coin base yet the security and trust in whats offered upon the simple coinbase acct.  is reasonable i believe.  The house always wins and i guess it should if it upholds a service and commitment to said service. Accepting i am not a trader on the coinbase platform knowing this and accepting that i must HODL as a savings acct. is one of the greatest experiences i have had personally on my device. 
   A greater level of customer engagement would be a great value increase for the reputation of the app.  Log in issues and quirks can not be related our consulted upon in any real way so beyond standard FAQ’s i have been left alone to understand certain quirks. It may be different on the fancier wallet or counbase pro i would not know cause i am not a trader i am merely a crypto addict who cant get enough btc! And squirrels away any pocket change i can ! 
 If you believe in btc and its synenergy to eradicate poverty in a large part, then i’d recommend a coinbase acct for yourself and family to build wealth for everyone on the planet.  With Aloha. &  Ma’at."
coinbase,ios,Shmyizer,3,2024-03-23 21:21:15,"I’ll start with saying since I’ve had Coinbase I’ve had very minimal issues. I’m giving only 3 stars because there’s basic fundamentals that should be in any type of “investing/trading” app. For example how much money a person (CURRENTLY) has invested in Coinbase. Example: Cost Basis for your Coinbase portfolio and for each individual crypto that a person buys. You should also be able to see your cost basis for each individual crypto you’re currently invested in. I think the “All time returns” is confusing and makes trying to figure out how much you’ve gained on different trades all the more confusing. Especially when you go to my assets a click on the crypto you’re currently invested in the only info you get is your total returns. Meaning if you bought and sold a crypto over a year ago and then bought the same crypto a year later it just adds all your gains together therefore you cannot tell how much you’re up for that current trade. I think Coinbase needs to seriously invest their time in fixing the fundamentals as they make it extremely confusing to understand how much you actually have invested in each crypto. They’re very simple features, I’m not really sure how this hasn’t been added yet considering they’re one of the largest public crypto exchanges."
coinbase,ios,kobe4la,1,2023-07-17 07:38:21,Had several thousands in xrp coins go missing under Coinbase over the period of years. I’m no expert in crypto but I still kind of have the jist of things going on. Couple of years ago xrp was delisted on Coinbase so we could no longer buy or sell xrp. But Coinbase said ok your xrp is still safe and secure in your Coinbase account. So ok I just left it there. Then a few months later they wanted you to transfer it to a Coinbase wallet because they didn’t want any responsibility for it. Ok I transferred it there so I do see it. Then the coins were transferred or moved out of Coinbase wallet and just disappeared. I guess they wanted to use my coins to “ stake” in their program or something. I emailed them and they said your coins are safe and you gotta do this laundry list of things but I always get an error. Let I remind you guys this was over the course of over two years. I hardly trade any coins I bought a bunch in 2021 and had the intention of just leaving it and forgetting it. Now in 2023 my coins are gone. Sure I accept responsibility I shoulda used a Trezor and kept my coins outside of Coinbase but I trusted them too much. I know I’ll just get a generic AI response to this but I just wanted to get the word out of what happened. Just like with many crypto exchanges it’s all a hoax. Only put money in if what your willing to lose entirely. They will make it very difficult to recover or ever get your money back.
coinbase,ios,1&24,1,2024-04-27 04:05:06,"I don’t know what’s going on with Coinbase, but when I first started using them and their wallet, it was very simple to use. Everything was done easily and you didn’t have that many problems switching over from the Wallet to Coinbase platform. Then they started adding all of this to Wallet​, making it difficult to transfer your money or to send money back-and-forth. I just was taken for over $650 because they are telling me I sent money from one wallet that is mines to another wallet that is mine but the token is not supported so I asked him my money back to the wallet and they’re telling me that they can’t can’t you this is not a decentralized platform like I don’t understand what’s going on and it doesn’t make sense. They stole my money and it’s not trying to help me get it back. They’re making it on purpose. It’s better off using a decentralized platform where you know that it’s a possibility of you losing your money then to be on Coinbase with the monitoring you and you can still lose your money have high transaction fees, and there’s no customers service to help you do anything, this is the second time something happened to me like the first time was with someone from somewhere else use my card from another country and they give me my money back. I’m just done with this. It doesn’t make sense now. I’m lost over $650 and they’re not even trying to help me."

I trusted it because it was an app launched from coinbase wallet. My understanding is it is my account and I hv full control of it, just like I have full control of my bank account, and all the apps launched from my bank account should be legible. That’s how I got tricked. The fact is, once I launch the app from coinbase wallet, I’ve signed “smart contract” which allows third party to withdraw from my coinbase wallet indefinitely. At first I thought coinbase is definitely responsible for allowing the scammer app to launch from their app, but it turns out that they deny the liability claiming in crypto world it is always “ur decision to make”, that freaked me out because it can legally allow anyone to take users money away without putting on any warning, which is even worse than real world. How can online bank account launch third party app without warning people it is possibly a scam and it has nothing to do with the bank, it is not hard to do so in coinbase and they refuse to put that warning, causing lots of ppl losing money from scam. I have full proof that the scammer claimed to be from coinbase and it is app launched from coinbase which made it more believable. Why can’t coinbase put on warning? Btw I lost 100k thx to coinbase!"
coinbase,ios,Madd Modder,1,2022-05-26 19:28:08,"Coinbase requires a valid government issued ID to send & receive anything. In states with “True ID” you don’t get a physical ID card the day of the transaction. It is mailed & doesn’t come until 10-15 days after getting your photo taken. Once that’s done the license authorizing place will issue a temporary license on paper. Coinbase will not accept this as a valid license. They require a physical plastic card license. Coinbase will allow you to deposit money but won’t allow you to send or receive anything until you have acquired your physical license. So, if you’ve already put money into your coinbase account at this point it’s now locked up and can’t be transferred until the physical plastic ID card has arrived. The only option you have is to withdraw back to the original bank account you sent it from. On top of that, if you attached a bank account and didn’t use wire transfer, your transferred funds are now on hold for approximately 5-7 business days. There is no warning or requirements that alert the user to need to complete their ID verification before transferring money into the coinbase account & that you will not be able to send or receive funds. Also, if you use an attached bank account that you transferred funds from into your coinbase, that money is subject to a hold time of appropriately 5-7 business days.

coinbase,ios,sj-2020,1,2022-04-18 23:06:32,"Coinbase seems to be the dominant crypto trading platform in the US, but this app is not by any chance close to a professional trading app! I read a ""Thank You"" review by another user because he had noticed the addition of ""Watchlist"" and ""New Coins"" to the app!! This is as childish as it can imaginably be! Are you guys at kindergarten or what?! Any trader, not the professional stock market traders, but even an average joe will realize how primitive coinbase app is! Cryptos are being traded 24/7 and we definitely need candle stick charts with technical indicators. What do we get with this app? A childish graph with absolutely NO indicators, NO candles, NO settings, basically NOTHING! The graphs are absolutely useless. I wonder if coinbase users trade by tossing coins or what?!! There are absolutely no helpful market tools such as filters, simple scanners, or any activity monitoring tools either. The watchlist is so primitive and lacks even the most basic functionality such as sorting. Any time I open this app I start hating to trade on this platform! Is there anyone at coinbase who has ever traded stocks?! I'm sure there is, and they know exactly how low profile this app is! But they have no serious will to upgrade it to something better probably because they feel they are not rivaled by any competitor! So, they keep their high commission fees and they do nothing to improve! What a shame!"
coinbase,ios,Dadsmash,1,2023-04-12 23:29:17,"Most importantly, I do not want anyone to have funds made unavailable and avoid painful situations. Always do a test send to and from Coinbase in small amounts this will ensure there are no net work issues or software bugs, resulting in potential loss of funds. Even if you have used that methods before it may change by the day or software update. Saved addresses will display the correct hash but may not always accurately apply saved memos. Unacceptable delays in send/receive timeframes exceed standards (coinbase claims to use a third party hot wallet service that is inefficient, slow, and potentially not liable for coinbase software/tech issues).

It’s unfortunate that coinbase is outperformed, overshadowed, and obsolete compared to almost every other exchange. It may be age of the company or the challenges to operate on the US, but as soon as the regulatory hurdles are cleared coinbase will be left in the dust if they don’t revamp the platform. A simple action such as sending XLM has become an overwhelming liability. I have had more money than I care to admit held hostage by coinbase due to technical issues when in fact it was all caused by the inadequate software used by CB and incompetent engineers. I am surprised that there have not been more complaints or worse from dissatisfied customers. If there were Breyer on ramp options in the US I would gladly forget this company and app."
coinbase,ios,MyBlackShirt,3,2021-10-28 22:56:30,"So this app is great for trading/purchasing crypto.  I’ve used it for nearly a year with no issues.  Now that this is out of the way:

The number of times that changes have occurred to the interface, then changed back, then changed to the prior version, then another…it’s maddening.  Here are my priorities: 1. See my portfolio balance and trajectory over (x) period. 2. See the coins I have and how they have faired over (x) period.  3. See what are the top movers over (x) period.  4. Trade one coin for another. 
When I can no longer do one of the above because of a UI change that adds functionality that is not one of my priorities, it is frustrating.  When I have no method of customizing the UI for my priorities to get it back, it’s frustrating.  When one of the missing priorities returns and then is removed or changed in a way that feels as if it were removed…it is frustrating.  
I’d rather not be frustrated, so please don’t remove features, if you must put something else in the UI, provide me with means to discover where the feature I care for is now located.  This will allow you to continue to experiment with new features while allowing me to continue to achieve my goals."
coinbase,ios,theo749,3,2022-12-07 21:56:26,"Update: the developer fixed the issue I had with logging in. The aspect ratio is somewhat improved but not great. The main issue I’m noticing now is that on the home tab, I’m unable to scroll or otherwise interact in any way with the screen. Everything seems to work fine in the other tabs. I’ve updated my rating from one star to 3 and will raise it to 5 once the remaining bugs are fixed. I appreciate the quick response, hopefully these bugs will also be resolved soon.

Old review: The other day, I got a notification that my portfolio had been migrated from Coinbase pro to Coinbase. I’m not sure why the developers decided to do this, Coinbase pro worked well enough but it wouldn’t have been been an issue if the Coinbase app worked on my iPad Pro. Why I opened the app, the screen was obviously designed for a phone, not a tablet. I had the same issue with pro but at least pro was still useable. With the Coinbase app, when I went to enter my email, the keyboard wouldn’t let me type in numbers. I have a lot of assets tied up in Coinbase, not being able to access it is a major problem. Please fix this bug and make a iPad friendly aspect ratio option."

Since then, and me hardly trading or moving my money out (long term hold, right?); when FTX collapsed, many of my friends were panicking, pulling money out, etc. I honestly didn’t think twice about dropping Coinbase!  I even use their Wallet App to hold and/or Stake assets. 
My research of Coinbase, again after FTX, showed I don’t have “a lot” to worry about. 
Their stock sure took a beating since the early days and the highs (I was purely lucky when I sold at 300s). However, balance sheet, financial statements , assets and Most Important - their “Coin” - the USDC, is (again) Stable and supported just enough for my comfort. 
Today, I needed to liquidate some of my assets, for a major transaction, and the App, UI, Flow, Options, Large Offering and speed of both, transfers, sales and sending money out to banks and financial institutions; I am very pleased and continue to have, again, “Just Enough” confidence in Coinbase as a company that I will continue to be a client and even probably, recommend it to friends, family and anyone who reads this review — With the Disclaimer — Do your own homework."

I transferred $400 from my bank account to my coin base account, And he says I’m ready for trading, I made a $100 tradeOne day and then when I tried to trade the other $300 the next day Coinbase said that I could not make the transaction because I was on able to get the money from my bank account which was just sitting there for the taking and it cost me a week and a half of training and I missed the drop on ETH. The coin base app told me to make a payment to correct the problem but the app kept saying it was having connection problems, and then two days later CoinbaseEmailed me a message, telling me they what’s going to take $400 From my crypto. So I called customer service and they have no clue on what to do. My wife had to do it from her phone to make the payment it went through, but I took another week before my account was in good standings, and by that time the market shot back up meaning I lost money for nothing."
coinbase,ios,Sexy boys 28,5,2024-01-27 08:32:04,"Coinbase is an amazing app for buying, selling, and managing cryptocurrencies. It has a sleek design, a user-friendly interface, and a variety of features that make it easy to navigate the crypto world. I love how I can track the prices of different coins, set up recurring purchases, and earn rewards by learning about new projects.

However, there is one thing that I think Coinbase should improve on: the user interface for iPad Pro tablet/keyboard. I use my iPad Pro as my main computer, and I find that the app does not fit well on the screen. The interface is the wrong aspect ratio, so there is a lot of blank space on the sides. This makes the app look less appealing and wastes valuable screen real estate. I wish Coinbase would optimize the app for iPad Pro users, and make it more responsive and adaptive to different screen sizes and orientations.

Overall, I think Coinbase is a great app for crypto enthusiasts, but it could be even better with some tweaks to the iPad Pro interface. I hope the developers will take this feedback into account and update the app soon."
coinbase,ios,Mfrielin,1,2021-01-16 19:46:05,"There are many things I like about Coinbase. Easy and intuitive interface, easy of trading between currencies, etc. But as I got more savvy in my trading and started tracking gains, I’ve found discrepancies between increases in currency rates and my balance. In other words, I would track the time in which I had made trades and calculate the amount that my balance should reflect. I found almost always that it was off and not by a little, by a lot. This is alarming to me as I see that there is real potential for fraud within this platform. In addition, I’d sent a transfer of funds from MY Binance account to my Coinbase account and after a week, I have yet to see those funds deposit to my ETC wallet that I’d used for the transfer. I’ve sent multiple customer service requests since then regarding the transfer both to Binance and to Coinbase. Binance has gotten back to me sharing the blockchain record of my transfer to my ETC Coinbase account indicating that I would need to remedy account receipts with Coinbase. I reached out to Coinbase and then have yet to respond. This was not a small amount. It is not okay for them to have inaccurate gains reflecting in account balances and no response on transactions that should have cleared over a week ago now. 

I will be filing a complaint with SEC outlining these discrepancies and their failure to remedy them."
coinbase,ios,Jay'sCraft,1,2022-04-04 10:02:47,"They 100% screw you over with fees. It costs 1.99$ to buy any type of cryptocurrency. If you want to trade one currency to another it costs $.99, and if you want to transfer it back to your bank account it costs another $1.99. So I have to pick the right currency, make sure it goes up at least $3.99 up in profit just to make any money? Which is very unlikely, because apps like these are designed to screw over the little people that want get into buying and selling crypto. I understand that the company has to make money some how, but charging every single transaction a bunch of money isn’t even fair. I was offered in app $1 in a crypto currency. Want to know how much it cost me to transfer it to any type of coin that made money? $.99. They offer you free crypto that is stagnant in price, to make you pay money to transfer it to other cyrptos. It’s so rigged. Do yourself a favor, and save your money instead of investing in this app. You’re basically throwing your money away if you buy anything on here.

Update: Tried cashing out because my stocks I invested in were up big time, app wouldn’t let me. Kept saying servers were down. And then because I was up so much (like $10 more) it charged me additional fees so I only ended up making $1. Are you serious Coinbase?! You have serious issues with fees. Stop charging so much."

I’ve always been stuck using 3rd party alerts for my coins as well as 3rd party decentralized platforms that have .10c fees per every transaction meanwhile I lose $3-$5 per transaction even for converting one to another. Throughout the many years of using coinbase the notifications have never worked accordingly or at all, I’m not just talking about the actual notifications but when you receive movement notifications they’re extremely behind. I won’t receive important alerts or notifications but then sometimes it will send me a notification every other hour, especially when there’s a lot of movement in the market. Just seems a little odd and slow for such a large company. coinbase vs literally what I use everyday will always be the last app to notify me accordingly of anything important. If we can also have an option to remove the “your USDC funds are low”. I don’t want to be told to fill my balance when I’m already planning on purchasing more just not right when the app tells me to This app gets more and more awful as it updates. 80% of it is a scam"

Lately I’ve put a lot and I mean A LOT of money into buying this most recent dip, had no problems until I decided to log on and found I wasn’t able to send any of my crypto. Over the next week, I lost the ability to cash out, sell do anything. Not a problem? I logged in, I have been asked to verify my identity 3 times and even then still my situation hasn’t improved. I later found a notification in my account that I owed them like $100? Weird but okay fine, I paid it. It took over a week for that to finally be cleared from my account but it took the money from my bank so I figured all was good, went back on and was asked to verify my identity AGAIN. Limits hadn’t been removed, still couldn’t send or anything. It’s impossible to get ahold of support, even with the live chat youre sat waiting there for 45 minutes for them to type a response and when they do it’s the same copy paste crap, customer support is completely unresponsive and impossible to get a hold of. So now I’m left with $1000 sitting in an account that I can do nothing on, do yourself a favor and go somewhere else."
coinbase,ios,Psyloh,2,2022-03-19 23:34:05,"I have been buying LRC on Coinbase for a couple months now, and I can’t believe it took me so long to notice, but they run the same scam that Robinhood runs with their crypto, except RH doesn’t charge a Transaction fee each time. Pay attention when you go to a coin. They show you the list price, but when you review your purchase before submitting it, they actually charge you a higher price/coin on top of their transaction fee. It’s the same thing with selling. They give you a lower rate than the listed price, as well as charging you transaction fees. They’re scalping customers, exactly the same way RH does by giving you, “the customer” a .03 cent spread. Even with the “Coinbase One” membership, this is still true.

If you can learn more complicated methods of trading crypto, I suggest that over this. If not, I hope you don’t mind getting scalped. The GOOD thing about Coinbase is that you can actually transfer your coins to different wallets, which shows they do actually have coins to give you should you actually request them sent to your wallet.

Response to Developers Response: This isn’t 2020. With everything that happened in 2021, investors are becoming wiser to things like Spread, PFOF, and the conflicts of interest in brokers and Wall St. in general."
coinbase,ios,SabinVI,1,2021-11-10 21:21:52,"The latest update to the Coinbase app has decreased functionality. Users like me want a snapshot of all their crypto investments on the homepage. This means to see their overall portfolio balance as well as all the coins on their watchlist. A quick overview with no further clicks. This is how it used to be. Now, in the latest version, the watchlist is limited to 5 items. If you want to see the rest of your items, you have to click into another screen. Horrible UI. It may seem small, but I check my investments multiple times per day. It used to be one simple click to open Coinbase, see my favorite coins, and done. Now every single time I open the app I have to click into multiple screens to see everything I want to see. Very annoying! Please fix this “upgrade” and bring back the old homepage with full watchlist functionality. Or better yet, let users create multiple watchlists like Robinhood where you can organize them better and maybe we can choose if we want them on the homepage or not. Removing a feature that your users have had for years is not a smart business decision. Robinhood shows all investments on the homepage and that’s why everyone always compliments their UI. I hope Coinbase can bring back what was the equivalent in the crypto world."

Look at all the real peoples reviews with reports of missing crypto and poor support. Their support is garbage their technicians don’t know what they’re talking about and refuse to help for simple things even when it’s clearly stated in Coinbases own policy. When you send facts and evidence they stop replying. Even the $5 free bitcoin promotion that is still shown here you won’t get it and they won’t help you or care after you make an account. If you decide to use Coinbase expect nothing but headaches transfers will go missing, any promotional bonuses or offers are fake you won’t really get them, if you contact support they will send you links to their support page that show what you contacted for and need help with is within their policy but then they just stop replying or make up bogus reasons of why they can’t help. It’s amazing this company is still able to operate when they break so many basic laws about false advertising and consistently screw over their customers.

coinbase,ios,A Small Investor,5,2024-02-19 00:50:43,"Coinbase has been a game-changer for me when it comes to managing and growing my digital assets. What I appreciate the most is its user-friendly interface, making it incredibly easy for both beginners and seasoned investors to navigate through the platform. The interest rates offered by Coinbase are very competitive, which is a big plus for anyone looking to earn on their cryptocurrency holdings. Without a doubt, it has enabled me to make decent passive income—nothing to brag about, but certainly a noteworthy addition to my financial portfolio.

Moreover, if you're like me, searching for additional avenues to increase your bank value, especially if you have cash just sitting in the bank, I highly recommend considering Coinbase. It's not just about trading cryptocurrencies; the platform offers various ways to earn interest on your holdings, which can be a smart move for long-term financial growth. My experience with Coinbase has been positive overall, and I believe it's a solid choice for anyone looking to explore the potential of cryptocurrency investments."
coinbase,ios,tonemccone,1,2023-03-17 00:44:13,"Updating from two to one star for the canned response they left on this review, which indicates they didn’t read it. Of course the funds aren’t available right away, but they shouldn’t continue to be held after the transaction clears with my bank. 7 full days is so arbitrarily long.

Original review:

Even after a transaction to buy crypto clears with your bank, they call it “pending” so they can hold it for the full 7 days. Any time a bank doesn’t let you access your own funds, it’s either security or it’s because they want to make money off your money. The longer it’s with them, the more they can make. Then, when you do want to move some money, they charge you super high fees to do it. Crypto is such a friggin’ scam. Not as bad as NFT’s, but still … it’s going to be a long time before crypto is actually worth it to most people, which is why it’s also so volatile and even a huge group of celebrities and investors can get scammed out of millions, like with FTX. Coinbase is just another company making money hand over fist without providing good support to customers or offering decent fees. They’re not FTX, but they’re profiting majorly off an unstable system without providing good support along the way, and charging an arm and a leg for their good enough services."
coinbase,ios,heddiepoo,1,2021-03-30 20:01:58,"I hate giving this rating given the fact that Coinbase has been my go to wallet but as of the last couple months it’s been absolutely HORRIBLE. When I ask to raise my limits from 50 dollar card purchases it somehow instead of being increased got lowered to $5.00. I emailed support over a month ago and they gave me a generic response saying that it was being sent up to review and would have someone email me back. This was a month ago and I am still waiting on that email. So ok that’s just a slight inconvenience because I can always just make a purchase with my bank account. WRONG every attempt made gets turned down due to “suspicious activity” which only gets worse because of the fact that this happened on not 1 but all 3 of my bank accounts connected. So once again I have to contact support. This time I try to call to actually speak to someone since they are unwilling to respond to support via email. What do you know, I run into another issue. Coinbase no longer has telephone support anymore. That’s only reserved for compromised accounts. So that’s great I have to email yet again... Here we are now and since I have been waiting to make this purchase BTC has only risen by about 15-20k or more. So thank you Coinbase for being absolutely worthless as of late."

I also purchased an asset I was told that it would be untradable after January 20, 2021 but if I had any of the asset remaining in your portfolio you would still be able to sell it , this is not the case. I’ve tried several times to rectify the situation but I’ve been unsuccessful. Sadly the only way to communicate with coin base is through text so it is very difficult to get your point across or for them to discuss something with you , it would be much better and a big improvement if you could communicate with an individual so you can express yourself and get situations handled much easier. I hope this helps anyone that’s considering to join the site and like I said before the majority of things on the site work great enjoy have fun don’t invest more then you can lose."
coinbase,ios,imlm4,5,2021-08-14 01:03:37,As an ole man who was investing first time in a decentralized currency who is ill-informed having limited knowledge of this specific subject matter began to observe - the  influence with this specific currency as a hedge against inflation in a addition to potentially replacing  gold as the preferred asset of choice globally- that aside I wanted - frankly needed or more importantly required a platform which was secure - easily navigation able- provided news and was regulated- Coinbase fit the bill- it provided a platform for a Baby- Boomer to comfortably invest for me and my family- i would like to see the transaction fees come down just a little as well as some additional tutorials -  other than these insignificant matters- I’m happy for the choice- one recommendation is to apply some of your $$$ to branding & marketing- the landscape out there is not only messy it is treacherous- I’m certain there are large portion of middle aged men such as I - that would utilize your platform to the exclusion of lesser known platforms if you would alleviate the fear quotient and distinguish Coinbase from its competitors
coinbase,ios,Alex132alex,1,2020-09-02 15:11:39,"This is the worst platform to trade on. They will charge you fees that you don’t even know about, and they will hold your money without any response to you. Their costumer service does not have a phone line and will respond to your emails or requests in only a few weeks after you submit a case. I have deposited funds and it’s been 3 weeks and I still can’t trade them, nor I can send them or withdraw like their policy says that you funds a  re w available immediately or in few days depending on how you make your deposit. I opened a dozen cases and and only response I got it is it’s on hold for security reasons after 2 weeks of submitting my case. Complete scam ladies and gentle man, I suggest you get a paid platform and trade with confidence because here that is not possible. Even their fees are hidden. I bought a BTC partially, actual BTC price was $11,300... but when you already buy it buys it for $11,450 even though the price of BTC didn’t even go near $11,400 that day. I opened 3 cases about a month back and no one responded yet. Guys don’t waste your time and patience. Find a better platform that is paid but you will be taken care off. I will continue to post my reviews on every review page to ensure that more people know what they are dealing with. Don’t let them play you."
coinbase,ios,Cl0ut96,3,2024-04-02 10:54:19,"First off i love coinbase, i’ve always used it to buy and sell crypto. But i just had the worst costumer service call of my life probably. First started out alright but could hardly understand the man. I was having trouble with buying and trading crypto because my account was on hold for funds even though i should be able to still put in money. When i would choose the buy button for a cyrpto currency it would bring up the normal options but wouldn’t give me any option of choosing my payment type and would give me and error. i kept trying to explain this over and over to the man but he kept giving me the same response that my account was on hold and proceeded to get rude and agrivated with me. i was just trying to resolve the issue because i had a chance to buy into a good opportunity that i knew would make me some money. i told him i didn’t understand why he was getting frustrated with me and then also proceeded to stop talking on the phone after the comment and hung up. Still never got the issue solved even after sending a screenshot via email to give them an example of what was happening."
coinbase,ios,Lizo664,1,2018-08-17 03:13:27,"All very fast and professional, right up until you try to cut your losses. Bought bitcoin with the intention of selling it a few days later for a (tiny) profit as more of an experiment than anything. I sent in my license photos, linked my bank account, and got everything verified. Bought a couple hundred in btc. A few days later the price has gone up a few hundred and I try to sell- to find my funds placed on a ‘24 day hold’ to ‘prevent fraud’. What?? If this is common practice, they certainly went out of their way not to mention it, and if it isn’t, I can’t think of any reason why they would have flagged me or my transaction as suspicious. I have now sat and watched the btc price plummet over $1,000 in the past few weeks. By the time I’m able to access my money I will have lost much of it. I understand that btc prices are famously erratic and I accept that I would have lost a little bit, but with every day I lose more and more of MY money which is being held from me. Incredibly disappointed with the lack of clarity in this matter. If it were not for this ridiculous, month-long freeze on my transaction, I would be very happy with this app. The layout is nice and the verification was fast and professional. However, any app that forces me out of MY money without forewarning is NOT a winner in my books."
coinbase,ios,I Mindfulboat!&,1,2021-11-28 12:41:06,"On November 24, I sent Approximately $1600 to another wallet. Shortly afterwards I received an email verifying all of the information, the amount and the wallet address and informing me that for “Security Reasons” there would be a 3 day hold on my transaction and that on November 27th, at 3:00 pm pacific time, my transfer would be completed. There was a link to verify my 5 year old account. If I completed this process, the wait would be cancelled. It required me to submit photos of both sides of my Drivers License and a selfie. Well, after several attempts, it didn’t like my selfie and said I needed to wait 24 hours before I could try again. This time it seemed to like it and said my account was “VERIFIED “ No transfer took place! When November 27th, 3:00 pm pacific time arrived ( yesterday ) no transaction took place. My account balance is $1600 less than it was and I have had no other communication from them. When I go to the “pay” tab at the bottom right and scroll down, it shows the transaction as completed 3 days ago. No record of the money still being at Coinbase, no money at the transfer destination. Your fees are insane and communication is horrible!  
WHERE IS MY MONEY??
As soon as possible, I will be removing the rest of my money from Coinbase to never look back."
coinbase,ios,Pismo123,1,2020-10-31 05:21:16,"There is absolutely zero customer support with coinbase. I’ve been trying for 2 days to reach an actual human about why my money is being held captive. I made a debit card purchase which is supposed to be instant. And it said there’s a 5 day hold on my funds. So after 2 days of trying to figure out why that is, I finally just gave up and sold the btc expecting to be able to withdraw my remaining cash balance. And I lost $10 in this process, over coinbase fees, and I didn’t even care. I just wanted my money back. But now there is a hold on my cash balance too! And I needed that money yesterday. I can’t afford to wait 5 days. But coinbase doesn’t care in the slightest. Because there is no way to reach anybody for customer support. You can email them, but you will just get a robotic response saying it will take 5-7+ days to fix your issue. So I’m pretty positive that nobody even actually reads the customer support emails. And now my only money is being held captive by this website that won’t even give me the time of day to tell me why. I’m extremely frustrated. This app is the worst btc app I’ve ever used, because this isn’t the first time I’ve had issues like this where “customer support” did absolutely nothing for me. Never coming back to coinbase after they finally stop holding my money captive."
coinbase,ios,Needs to be on Xbox or ps3,1,2020-10-20 05:24:20,I’ve been dealing with Coinbase Support for 6 weeks now and my issue still has not been resolved. You can only contact via email which takes days for them to reply and most times its a automated response. Once you actually get a real response its often vague and instructions that are already listed on their website. If you’re having issues with staking certain crypto currencies then good luck on getting them fixed because I am still unable to stake. They claim my account is unverified but yet I have went through the verification process numerous times and even have level 3 (highest level) verification on my account. I have tried contacting on social media and have gotten nowhere. I have tried callihg but can’t even get to speak to a person because they only will deal with account compromises over the phone which is a total load of crap. I would not recommend coinbase solely because their support services are atrocious. you are likely to have an issue when encountering this platform and will need their help at some point. I have friends who have had similar experiences in the past with different issues and experienced the same level of aggravation for coinbase support.
coinbase,ios,DanielleR78,5,2021-04-26 11:52:53,"I currently use cashapp for my Bitcoin but I was curious to see what other apps there were for crypto.I read on the internet that Coinbase was great for buying and selling. So I did download it but before I signed up I went back and started reading the reviews from people who have downloaded it and have been using it. Let me just say that I can’t remember ever seeing an app with so many horribly bad reviews! Out of all the ones that I ran there was only one that was an OK review not even a good one just an OK but all the other ones were bad really bad. People are getting money taken from their bank accounts without initiating it or authorizing it people were being locked out of their accounts and then nobody from Coinbase is answering anything no emails no nothing no one‘s doing anything about it so if anyone read this I would stay away from Coinbase I’m definitely deleting it right now, I am not putting any of my information in there! I’ll stick with Cashapp and PayPal I know I can trust them."
coinbase,ios,OnceBurnedTwiceShy,1,2022-04-26 18:59:33,"I’ve been using Coinbase for several years and though it wasn’t perfect the app filled most of my needs. I didn’t even mind that they charge higher than average fees.
I recently took a couple months off trading but woke up one morning to a call from my bank that Coinbase was attempting to withdraw $5,000 from my account. An action I certainly did not initiate as I was well aware I had less than $10 in the bank.
I contacted Coinbase immediately and notified them that my account had been hacked. Yet somehow they had instantly credited my crypto account for the $5,000 and then allowed it to be sent somewhere. Now I have never been able to send or withdraw funds until they cleared the bank but I guess the hacker just had the special touch.
Two months went by and I still hadn’t heard from Coinbase, so I reached out to them again. At which time they inform me that my account is locked until I pay for the missing funds! Their reasoning is that I somehow allowed my account to be hacked. Well the way I see it the most logical explanation given the turn of events is that it was hacked from within Coinbase itself. Anyhow they can keep the account locked because they won’t be seeing me or getting my business again."
coinbase,ios,Bairex12,1,2021-11-25 11:47:32,"I would give no stars if possible. Coinbase are scammers. They clearly have an agenda and it isn’t a good one. They had a glitch with the GYEN coin and mind you THEY HAD A GLITCH. Then they decided they wanted to penalize everyone that purchased or cash out when that glitch happened. Mind you I didn’t know it was a glitch so I was extremely happy that this coin made me some money. Then the nightmare began. Coinbase drained all of my account without no warning  saying I owed them money when it was their fault. I had other coins also not just this one which is extremely frustrating. Then they proceeded to change the history of my transactions which by the way I have screenshots of the original transactions. They are on some shady shady business and I have already lawyered up. Coinbase will not win this battle it doesn’t matter how long I have to fight I will fight for how many ever years they drag this out . Coinbase should just take their loss and continue to do business because I know for a fact I am not the only one going thru this. Coinbase do the right thing and GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK AND MY ACCOUNT. To those who haven’t yet downloaded this app STAYYYYY AWAYYYYYYY there are many other cryto trading platforms and wallets that are not this shady, money hungry, and unfair."
coinbase,ios,Mommyfreez,5,2023-11-10 22:46:53,"I gave this app 5 star just because it deserves it, I mean if you talking about customer support they are always fast and good at what they do, security so good, buys and sells doesn’t have no issue. But the main problem I have with this whole thing is LIMIT of buys” if you give a customer 250 as limit just leave it as 250 until you see its worth it to increase the limit, why decreasing limit just because a card is added or card is deleted? I mean I hate this like it’s very annoying! Someone’s on 750 limit for buying crypto, because he/she is unable to buy for a week or buys lower than that amount Coinbase set for the account, they quickly reduce it. That’s very bad honestly and it needs to be addressed! Please leave the limit once you’ve increased it, you guys can wait for as long as you want the person to trade before you increase the limit for the profile if it’s worth it, but decreasing is very bad and makes someone wants to try another app. Dang it!"
coinbase,ios,MD drawer,1,2021-10-27 22:09:23,"Coinbase is a fee-based software that allows regular individuals to invest their hard-earned cash in cryptocurrency. Coinbase, unlike other apps, charges a high fee for clients to store and secure funds in Coinbase crypto wallets. You'll also pay a market buy/sell price that's substantially more than the actual price of the coin you're buying. For example, if you buy a $1000 coin with $1000 in cash, you will receive about $900 of the coin you just bought. Coinbase charges you a high fee for holding and securing your cryptocurrency once you're ready to sell (regardless if it was for a minute or a year). Furthermore, you will receive a market buy/sell price that is far lower than the actual price of the coin you are selling. For example, if you sell the same crypto you just bought for $1000 and only got $900 in crypto, you'll earn roughly $800 in fiat. This is robbery in broad daylight, in my opinion. 

When you trade or exchange Cryptos with other Cryptos, it gets even worse. Because there is no easy way to contact these crooks, their customer service is non-existent. I hope they put an end to this open-air robbery and consider hardworking individuals like me who have lost a lot of money due to the fees these people charge."

Now you are kicking me off the system after you forced me to RE-verify all of my information leading me to believe I would be good. I could have been started to withdraw my money now I have to wait an additional 10 more days. When I told you guys about this erroneous transaction I was told in an email also on February 1 from you that “ If you do not have enough funds in your bank account to cover this purchase, then allow the transaction to reverse and reprocess with your bank. If we’re unable to successfully complete the transaction with your bank, we will attempt to recover the value of your funds held onsite.” I left the money there didn’t trade any additional stock with it waited for you guys. When I found out I couldn’t make any more transactions they gave me an option to give it back. This option was not told to me in the email. You can check. I immediately gave it back when I seen that option so why am I being penalized? I even took the money out of the stock in the event it dropped I didn’t want your money to be affected. To kick me off the site after dragging me along an entire 14 days with almost 2k tied up is pretty ridiculous."
coinbase,ios,davidjpfeiffer,1,2020-05-03 01:25:24,"I downloaded this app to start investing in bitcoin, and I spent a few days setting it up. I even made one test purchase, which was successful, just to make sure I would be ready to buy when the price was low. When that time came, I attempted to buy a much larger amount. I had plenty of funds in my bank account, but every time I attempted to make a purchase the app claimed that there were no funds. I contacted my bank and they said that no one had even attempted any transactions. It was clearly a bug on their end, and when I reported it, they disabled buying on my account completely. I was unable to buy any amount of bitcoin, despite having thousands of dollars ready to transfer from my bank account. I had to sit and watch as the price of bitcoin soared, unable to buy any with the app I had spent several days setting up. As I watched the price soar, the only response I could get from customer service (which is only available via email) was that I “needed to have enough funds in my bank account”.

The app has tons of bugs. The fees are high. The customer service is trash. I missed out on a great investment opportunity because of software bugs in this app. Don’t make the same mistake as me, find a different way to invest in bitcoin."

The live chat is only an AI that can’t help with anything if it’s not basic. And yeah, there’s no phone number or no way to get a hold of a real person. So then your money is just stuck in limbo. I suggest not investing or using this app. and I find it funny that a lot of people have similar or same complaint yet for some reason there says five star review and under that five stars they’re complaining about the app."

Due to personal reasons I unexpectedly had to change my phone number and email, and since I forgot my password I have no way of verifying my account. I have been attempting to reach support for over three months now in order to gain access to my old account. I’ve entered three separate cases, each time referring to the previous case number to which I inform no one ever answered. I was told on the last two attempts that someone would review my case and get back to me. The very last time I was told that because I reached out several times about the same issue (even thought THEY never answered. The tone read very condescending) it would be consolidated into one email thread and that I would hear from someone in 4-5 business days. That was 16 business days ago. I emailed back ONCE AGAIN this past Friday and now Monday have still not gotten a response. This is the most infuriating experience and I agree with other users it’s negligent and criminal to give individuals no way of speaking to someone in person and making it impossible to access one’s own funds. I would never recommend Coinbase now based on this experience."

On Monday morning my balance in cb was $170, my balance in my web3 wallet was $70; at night the balance was $111 and $0 respectively with no transactions, and no movement in my holdings. I thought someone had gotten into my account but my transactions didn’t show it, and I noticed retroactively the amounts (1 week change) were lower. I started a chat with customer service. The real (I guess?) rep told me to check my transactions, and I told them to look at the individual balances (bitcoin, eth) which did equal $170. They did not seem to get what i was saying which is the app appeared to lose my money. They told me they’d have an email tech reach out to me (never happened). 

On Tuesday I opened the app again and my balances fluctuated between 111 and 170 (like in real time, it was going up and down); then my web3 balance went from 0 to 59. I screen shot. 

It’s just a few hundred bucks; but I’ve had thousands in here and I wouldn’t again: I’m withdrawing my funds. I get it; they did a software update. What’s wild and shocking is how totally unaccountable they were about it and ill equipped to manage my “hey you lost my money help” inquiry. Scammy vibe."
coinbase,ios,Ditalian,1,2017-11-19 14:25:49,"I started with coinbase and was charged excessively for buying BTC ETC LTC. They feed on newbies entering the market and charge ridiculous fees per buy or sell. It’s called taking that initial hit because you pay for the convenience. Put your money on coinbase and transfer it directly to GDAX(also owned by coinbase) 

This is an easy way to get into the cryptocurrency, but for the uninitiated it is not a trading platform. GDAX is. You can fund your COINBASE account, but they neglect to tell you that you can make a GDAX account and transfer your money free of charge and buy/sell/trade for minimum fees. Limit buys and sells are free on GDAX. The pros: COINBASE is legit and GDAX is legit. They are FDIC protected and your legal tender is insured by the federal government because it’s held in an escrow account in a bank. Your coins are insured by insurance policies. BUT It would be nice to be informed ahead of time that you can incur substantially higher fees using the simplified ap and that if your going to be trading short or long term, that transferring your funds to GDAX (an actual exchange) results in much lower fees and free limit orders. 

I’m quite happy with GDAX and my only issue is the taking advantage of newbies entering this volatile market without the foreknowledge that there sister company offers extremely lower rates."

Coinbase didn’t want take my money. After multiple attempts at trying to buy I was told I have insufficient funds. Every time!!! I go and check my back account and everything is fine I have the funds. For some reason it didn’t let me buy anything that day. This is not how it works I choose the days I want to invest and how much. I didn’t surpass any limit of any kind, and I had the latest version downloaded. Even my Mac version didn’t let me invest. I decided to open up an account on other crypto investing platform. I honestly don’t have time for this. It’s ridiculous and I’m still heated. I just want to know what happen to my first review? Was it deleted? 

Also the most sketchy part about this platform is the TRANSACTION PRICES weren’t adding up. I started documenting every time it doesn’t add up. Which isn’t hard since Coinbase makes it easy to access it. Just because Coinbase gave me free crypto doesn’t it works the other way around."

They didnt open a case they told me the 10 DAY WAIT PERIOD IS YOUR POLICY AND THEN CLOSED THE CHAT.  GARBAGE COMPANY ANY OTHER Crypto exchange is better.  DO NOT USE.  They advertise you can send things LTC instantly after purchase and then after you buy they tell you it cant be sent for 10 days.  Customer service is only staffed by mentally handicapped losers....Ive submitted 3 tickets for my ether purchase not showing up even though I have the email confirming the purchase and the money has left my bank.  I gave you the reference number the date and amount and you close the ticket each time with the same canned response of not finding the transaction, obviously customer service isnt reading the tickets they are just closing them out so they can look like they are actually helping people.  I put in my 4th request for my purchase to be posted today and I bought this back on April 21, you are pathetically bad at this and the only reason people use you is because of marketing.

coinbase,ios,jang Abadi,4,2017-12-03 04:11:32,"Coinbase is great. However, it takes 4-7 days for your transactions to clear when using your bank account, or linking your bank account. Even though im not planning on selling anytime soon, it shouldnt take so long for my purchases to be approved and show up in my wallet or portfolio. Also, they recommend using or linking your bank account, instead of using your debit card which is immediate and doesnt take 4-7 days to clear. Why does it take so long to clear? 
I understand that they want to make sure funds are in your account (i assume), but 4-7 days, is way too long. I dont think i can sell anything until everything has cleared. I also noticed that the $ was already taken out of my bank account- so why are they not available as soon as you have taken the money out of my account? The good thing i guess is that the price i purchased them at is locked in. But still would be nice if they were in my portfolio as soon as the money has been taken out of my account. All in all, this is a great, easy and fast way to buy crypto !"

Anyway I buy some ETH and only spent $1,200 and decided to pull the remaining $800 out. Then ETH dropped hard so I transferred $500 back into Coinbase and got cold feet so I didn’t buy anything, the money sat in my cash account. When it allowed me to withdraw it I took the $500 out and moved it to my bank account. 2 days later I got a message saying insufficient funds ($500) well I was going to move it back over and then let it clear and put it back into my bank again. Well they stole the money from me! They took the $500 and it disappeared. Contacted support multiple times and no responses other than “we have a specialist looking into it” and weeks go by with no responses. 

I want you to do some research on google before you give this company any money and just look at the amount of fraud claims they have against them. This company is terrible and I suggest giving your business to someone else. They refuse to help anyone with issues when they know it’s their fault!"

I got a notification from coinbase stating that my account has been locked because purchases that were made we’re unable to be funded by my locked money market account. That same day I linked another account and money was in coin base covering the two other purchases that I had made. At that point coin base told me understandably that I would be locked out of any further purchases until customer service viewed my account. It took a week for customer service to get back to me. Then out of the blue they send me an email stating that they have irreversibly block my account from any other trades or crypto purchases and that I would have to liquidate my entire account and no longer be available to use coin base. Not sure why this happened and without any explanation I thought I did everything correct besides making that first mistake.
Trust me, I have a 750 plus credit rating and cash to cover more purchases.  Coinbase’s customer service did this extreme action for in my opinion was a minor error.  You make the call."

Good luck with that!! I have tried and tried with no success. How can this company be trusted with your funds? Yet the tout themselves as the most secure and reliable platform. This is a LIE! If Coinbase was a responsible steward with our finances then this issue would already be resolved and my review would be a 4 or 5. As it stands it’s really a 1 but I added a star because the customer service really tries to resolve issues. A company that is riddled with errors and tries to be so secure they take your money but then won’t let you have access to it should not be trusted as a financial company nor a digital platform for managing money. I am incredibally disappointed.
coinbase,ios,anon777462,1,2022-03-22 09:57:24,"I used Coinbase for small trading and to fund other accounts that only accept crypto. For over a year my deposits and withdrawals were almost instant. Now all of a sudden if I want to withdraw any of MY money, I have to wait 18-23 days to withdraw or send anything? I called customer service and repeatedly received the scripted “we do this for security purposes” response. I tell them that the account is mine and so is the back account it’s linked to and ask what I can do to verify that the withdrawals are not fraud. She did not have a response so I asked to speak to a senior representative. Once the senior rep gets on the phone, I state my issue again. This person says “let me check on that” and then kept me on hold for over 40 minutes and counting. As I write this review I am still on hold.  It does not make sense to hold people’s money for “security purposes” but won’t allow the account holder to verify any information in order to release the funds. I’m losing hundreds/thousands of dollars because of this. As soon as my money is released I am withdrawing everything and deleting my Coinbase account. 

Update: Still on hold. It’s been an hour and 2 minutes now."
coinbase,ios,anystshiv,5,2019-12-30 15:08:12,"Most of these bad reviewe are pathetic, i have been with coinbase for over a year and thw only issue I wver had was verification. Customer service toon a few days to respond but explained, i can use my prepaid debit card through Metabank but cannot use my Metabank account to withdraw funds. I have been paid, recieved my funds, within the given processing time. Maybethese users did not fully verify theor accounts or maybe they used VPNs and from non-permitted countries, but also the most recent reviewers, beed to understand last week was a holiday week and this week there is new years day  so many businesses customer service will not be available and responses are delayed  This included coinbase. Also maybe read their FAQs and agreements and see what is not allowed because buying crypto not approved by them, is in a sense, not okay and it even states it in their system. So do not blame them for uour stupity. I would rather use coinbase over Blockchain whuch is way harder to ise, transfer, exchange, and most of the wallets dont work"
coinbase,ios,Gus-315,1,2025-01-18 17:50:38,"If you want an app that has 0 customer support and want to deposit big amounts just to not be able to use them this is your app! I initially deposited $1000 dollars into the account and could not use it. For what ever reason they emailed me and told me the funds could not be pulled, upon this email they send me a link to make the payment again. After depositing another 1,000 into the account I then got 2 pulls form my bank account. So now I’ve deposited $2,000 when I initially only wanted $1,000 in. I’ve tried plenty of times to reach out via email, support, and even waiting for hours on the phone for someone to pick up. This is unacceptable for the customer, they will purposely not answer and have you waiting for hours on the phone so that you can just hang up eventually and not resolve your issue. Shame on you Coinbase, that’s not even the end of it. Coinbase has no actual phone number you can call, you just place a call order and the automated system will continuously repeat “thank you for calling, we care about your feedback, your call will be taken in the order it was received. This will continue for literally hours and still won’t get a response."
coinbase,ios,SheDaDevil,3,2021-02-17 14:50:36,"I’m giving coinbase three stars because I feel that there’s still a lot of features that are missing in this app that can make it much better. 
One of the things that first off I noticed they do not offer a grace period for their fees like many of the other apps will offer 30 days without fees but this app does not do that.
Also the app does not make it easy to see what’s been invested in the track your investments by cryptocurrency‘s you actually have to click into each cryptocurrency individually to see what you purchase them at and where the current values that so it’s not easy to track your overall investment portfolio performance.
Lastly there’s no a crypto wallet or earn potential within the app you have to download a different app for that and also they list all the crypto currencies but you have to sort to “tradable” because all the cryptocurrency’s that are listed are not tradeable  in this app so it’s kind of misleading until you go to the “tradable tab” and then you can see which cryptocurrency’s or actually available to be purchased through this app.  
It’s Good but could be MUCH BETTER!"

I could convert crypto’s into others but that was it... I was restricted to conversion. I couldn’t even sell it I to the USD holding account, could not sell it to my verified checking account. Then I was told to contact support, took them forever. Denied anything was wrong and closed my support case before it was resolved several times. Bitcoin went down in that period, all crypto did... so conversion lost me money, they didn’t help... and I couldn’t sell it. And I had everything needed to do all those things! I was powerless to sell it during the downturn... so the essentially had control of my money for three months where I couldn’t do anything. That’s essentially stealing Coinbase... frustrating your clients enough where at one point I almost gave up and let you have my money, which makes me ask how many people have this issue... and why when I switched to the Cash App and did everything including setting up an account, sending the coin from you to them, selling the Bitcoin... why did that only take a day with them, and months with you?

coinbase,ios,JeffAnononomous,1,2025-02-16 13:52:20,"After completing gall lucid measures a year ago, Coinbase arbitrarily decided that I am no longer who my birth certificate says I am who the IRS says I am who all of my mini creditors say I am but of course Coinbase has to be right, correct. Not even close. Their technology is poor quality and they lack the basic ability to examine identifying documents and evaluate the sameness of two identical copies of a that document. They want you to add a correlating selfie and the ID verification, but they lack the competence to add the additional information that is required into the link that they publish all over their website. They don’t tell you that their app is substandard and is not capable of running the verification appropriately  so the website has to be used. Then they simply ghost you when they have proven overwhelming that they lack the technical ability to facilitate their own processes and lead you ton over tax their little website protocols. The sad thing is that they over promote themselves and by the time you realize they cannot deliver you have lost access to a slew of accounts and assets because Coinbase is deceptive and dishonest."
coinbase,ios,Gnostic Seeker,5,2024-03-06 19:58:16,"Consistency is key! 
I have 30% of all wallet’s available, mostly for research and testing and Coinbase stays in the top two as most reliable, secure, dependable to alert of potential problems, issues, or possible vulnerabilities or suspicious/fraudulent new crypto assets or protocols to remain aware of. There introduction of learn and earn crypto courses is good, however I believe there should be a considerable amount more invested into deeper knowledge courses perhaps integrated with mixed protocols or Dex and DeFi where crypto account holders are walked through swapping and utilization of some of the lesser known cryptocurrencies giving us more confidence when interacting with them. Of course if they are allowed on Coinbase we are assuming each one is vetted carefully and it’s fairly safe to interact with them. 

Education right now is much more valuable than any marketing campaign, because word of mouth, coupled with capable users who can teach the next person, is something you cannot buy."
coinbase,ios,JaneTrades,1,2020-08-10 17:17:51,"There is no customer service number to call if anything happens to your assets, which is a very scary thought considering mistakes happen all the time with Coinbase. For example, I purchased $500 worth of a coin as it was just beginning a massive bull run. At first, the payment went through and then a week later I checked my account and all my crypto I had purchased was gone. Turns out the “payment had failed” even though I had well over $500 in my bank account. I contacted Coinbase through email to ask them what happened and to reimburse me for my coins, telling them I’d happily provide bank statements to prove I had the funds available. They responded with NO explanation and told me I could no longer make any purchases in the app. Their mistake has so far cost me $1200 I would have made on my trade. An institution that handles personal finances absolutely MUST have a customer service line. Can you imagine if you bank misplaced your money and you couldn’t call them to fix it? I made the trade to help pay for my dog’s life saving surgery and now after all my research, analysis, and a very smart trade, I have nothing to show for it. Do yourself a favor and find another crypto brokerage to go through. Coinbase will screw you over."
coinbase,ios,chanAlia,1,2025-01-21 15:51:03,"I recently had an extremely frustrating experience with Coinbase regarding a transfer of approximately $335 from my Coinbase Wallet to my Coinbase account. Despite completing the transaction, I never received the funds in my account.

In an attempt to resolve the issue, I sought support online, only to find that helpful resources were lacking. The platform offers no immediate assistance, and getting in touch with a live representative proved to be a challenge. After waiting for nearly seven hours for a callback, I finally had the opportunity to explain my situation to a customer service representative. She requested the transaction hash to track the funds but ultimately provided no assistance, simply stating that the funds were lost.

The lack of timely and effective support, coupled with the loss of my funds without a clear resolution, has left me deeply dissatisfied with Coinbase's service. As a financial platform handling users' assets, I expected a higher standard of customer support and accountability. Unfortunately, this experience has eroded my trust in Coinbase, and I would caution others to carefully consider their options before using this platform for transactions."

Being that it was a holiday my check wasn’t deposited in time to cover a deposit I made to my account which was a trivial amount. I received the email to cover the amount, nearly the second I seen it. I attempt to use the hundreds of dollars worth of crypto I have on my account no luck, then I tried depositing money no luck. The next week I finally get to use the money I deposited it clears. And I still have no access to my account. Any other service I ever used it never took close to three weeks to make minuscule progress towards being able to move my own money. Obviously being a Coinbase one member I reach out to support 3 separate times to get absolutely no resolution. So I’m paying for a service I haven’t been able to use in three weeks , no access to my own money. Nor time table to when I can receive it.

I DID NOT INITIATE THIS TRANSFER, and it led to overdrafting my bank account since i did not have funds for a second transfer. Not only did coinbase do this, but they also froze my coinbase account and are saying that they are going to be recovering funds. When i go to my history on coinbase, it doesn’t even reflect the second transfer - and YET i’ve been getting emails about recovering funds for it, and my account has been frozen! Make it make sense. I can’t even give a reference number because there is no reflection of a second transfer when i go into the app! MAKE IT MAKE SENSE. I’m so unhappy with Coinbase.

I spent 7 hours with support trying to recover my money , and get my name change taken care of. The website tells you to upload your new id to verify your new legal name.  Was on with like 10 different agents over 7 hours. One of them told me I needed to upload my supporting court document. Which I did… they told me it was accepted. So I then was told to upload my new iD to verify my account. Which I did, they then locked me out of trying again. Which earlier they kept telling me to resubmit it. The next agents told me to resubmit my iD which some how I was able to. They still denied it, then turned around and told me I’ve tried uploading identification from two different people.  Told them to check my account and the portal for the name change decree. They kept telling me I’m two different people … they also told me I’d have to open another account if I wanted to use coinbase. Taking my access to my crypto.

coinbase,ios,Vįć,5,2021-08-26 20:42:24,"This is literally the smoothest, easiest and most non-complicated cryptocurrency app out there. As I was starting out to learn about and invest in cryptocurrency, I was suggested a few but ever since I explored Coinbase, I’m hooked. Even though I don’t afford to buy much, this app has got me in to a habit of saving and investing slowly and gradually. Its educative and very informative, means you won’t feel lost. Although they do have some popular cryptos missing and I can see how that could be a dealbreaker because it’s a missed opportunity, but for someone who’s starting out, there’s nothing like Coinbase, it LITERALLY has everything you need. By the way, I see they’re bringing more currencies on board gradually which is great! I’m really very happy with Coinbase and for anyone reading this and contemplating how you should invest in crypto and what’s the best way to do it, I’d say do it with Coinbase. You’ll love it! Thanks and keep up the great work Coinbase team 😃👍🏻"
coinbase,ios,rzvvf,1,2022-04-21 13:09:44,"This is my story, which hopefully gives you a sense of what you might have to deal with. I created an account and bought some crypto. A few hours later I noticed that my account is restricted and is flagged for manual review. What I should’ve done at that time was to dispute the charge on my credit card and cancel the transaction, but unfortunately I didn’t because I thought they have a legit business and will take care of it. So, I reached out to customer service and it took them several months to reply and then they asked me to upload a copy of my identity documents through some random website. Now, given that Coinbase website itself was hacked, why should I trust a random website introduced by Coinbase to upload my documents? So, I figured the amount of crypto I have in my account is not worth it to upload my documents through their method which is not safe (in my opinion. Obviously they think it’s safe, but I do not trust data safety comments from a company that has been hacked before) and might create a bigger headache for me in future. So, I gave up at this point; it doesn’t feel good though; I feel like my money is stolen."

But the coin I was looking in to at the time had a complicated presses for getting the coin through Coinbase. so I never went through this app.  Now in the last month I have had two emails saying I have requested to change my password.  I have not even been on the app for months so I was confused/concerned.  So I put the coinbase app back on my phone and logged in with no problem. Change my password and made sure there was no important information on there.  Then I get another email saying that I requested to change my password again.  So I again log in and change my password.  I try to call and talk to someone a person not a recording/prompt and they only allow me to put a ticket in.  So I guess that I will just lock the account and delete it in hopes that no one will get in and get my SS# or any other personal info.  

In short a little person to person communication would go a long way.  Or a report option on the password change request email."

And I cannot stress this enough because anytime I’ve had to use any sort of financial systems customer service, I’m usually greeted with the “there is nothing we can do sir, apologies and have a fantastic day.” Which is not what you want to hear when you’re trying to recover lost funds.

When I receive my bank statement, coinbase had actually double charged my bank account. 75 twice and 100 twice. So now I have 350 deducted from my bank and only 175 in my coinbase account. Frustrating to say the least. So I did a stop payment through my bank and got 75 and 100 back, awesome right? No, I then receive an email from coinbase saying I need to link another bank account to my coinbase account. Otherwise they will sell the crypto I have in my wallet on there app. Mind you they have already taken 350 from me, I got 175 back and they still want money from me. I plan to attempt to reverse the remaining 175 they took from my bank, and walk away. Imagine if you deposited 1000 or even 5000 in there and they double charge your account.

I tried submitting a support ticket many times but they automatically close the case for not sending the ticket through a “verified” device.

The customer support provided no specific reasons despite my adherence to all Coinbase's requirements, leaving me in a state of confusion and frustration.

I am facing the reality of being forced to withdraw my funds, diminished by transaction fees, under circumstances that have not been clearly justified. The generic responses about 'security and compliance' are not satisfactory, and my attempts to seek a detailed explanation have been unsuccessful.

This experience has compromised my trust in Coinbase, and I am compelled to escalate the issue through a chargeback process due to the lack of support and transparency. I demand a direct and detailed explanation from a senior representative and an assurance that my case will be reviewed with the seriousness it warrants.

It turned out that PayPal (which works well with all my other merchants) actually declined those transactions, HOWEVER I was never notified of that issues and Coinbase DOESN’T HAVE THAT FEATURE to notify its customers is a transaction failed. After an hour and providing the supervisor with info and feedback I got no “thank you” for helping them uncover a real issue with the app and no compensation for any of my transactions which were apparently denied but never reported to me. I’m looking for a new Crypto App to switch over to.

After a few years of moderate investing and using the free Coinbase earn feature for learning about various cryptos and getting a few dollars, I’ve managed to quadruple my portfolio. I’m not a serious or experienced trader, so this app is perfect for me. My only complaint would be that the fees seem a little high when you make multiple transactions and the undercutting of the price to allow for market fluctuations always seems to be more extreme than necessary, but if you take that into account as you make your sell orders, it all kind of evens out. This app is more ideal for HODLing, but I make some trades here and there as things go up and down. I’ve tried other apps and didn’t like the UI or just didn’t trust them. For that, I choose Coinbase. Just make sure you have a wallet, not your keys, not your crypto."

I understand the heavy interest in crypto has bogged down support, which I have sympathy for. Expecting customers to sit on their hands for 30+ days without any response is unethical and morally demeaning. 

If you are reading this review to see if you should be downloading the Coinbase app, please do not do it. Look elsewhere.

The crypto industry is still emerging. Coinbase should follow the customer priority model of Gemini. When I had a customer support issue with Gemini’s new app back in 2018, not only did I get quick 2hr email response detailing the probable cause but I also received a conference call minutes later from the dev team inquiring the steps leading up to the issue so it didn’t happen to anyone else. The team literally fixed the issue with me, live on the phone within minutes and I was extremely happy to help. 

That’s how it’s done Coinbase, where the customer is priority #1 , not just their money."
coinbase,ios,tbinesteak,1,2018-10-13 17:22:19,"Update: DONT TRUST BUYING BITCOIN THROUGH THIS APP USE CASHAPP!! I believe it’s good to use this app for withdrawals , I’m not sure yet I haven’t used to withdraw yet however if you purchase bitcoin through this app you will be out of at least $20+ depending on how much you purchase. Not all of your money is accounted for and now they unverified my account so I no longer have access to my funds but my account had to be verified for me to even purchase my funds! I am not enjoying my experience through Coinbase at then moment. I’m not one to complain especially if issue gets resolved , i understand new software having issues so if this is new I would understand but I need communication! They do not do a good job in handling my issues , instead they unverified my account and said they can’t further assist me until my account is verified and I’m trying to verify my account but it will not accept the photos of my pic ID! I’m getting very annoyed with Coinbase, I purchased through cashapp and they have lower fees and it’s a much easier process to verify your identity! I just wish I didn’t purchase a large amount with Coinbase , seeing I don’t have access to my funds, and there’s nothing to do about it !!!"
coinbase,ios,11thzone,5,2021-06-02 11:53:54,"PROS:
Gives easy access to cryptocurrency trading. 
“Instant” deposits. (More on this below.)
App is user friendly and simple. 

CONS:
Gives easy access to cryptocurrency trading. 
Instant deposits allow purchases, positive cash flow is needed for high frequency trading. (Duh)
App is way too simple. Even Pro is too limited. We need far more functionality and features. Tracking data of trades etc etc. Charts need improvement. Other Apps should not rival a Billion dollar company in tracking cryptocurrency. You need better CS. Use TDA as your model, not RbnHd.
It should be more clear when funds have cleared the bank, and when cryptocurrency becomes transferable. The Portfolio should only have assets managed in list form. A ”Coin List” can show all coins available, tradable, etc, and a Watchlist are in dire need of inclusion. I also don’t understand the multiple app approach. Account privilege status should be set up in an account hierarchy that grants access to higher levels within the App, not split up into separate Apps. 

Over all great experience so far. Reliable yet limited, but does what it does well. Let your deposits clear before you transfer coin. Know the limitations and pray for updates. Still recommended highly even though this review may sound super critical. That is not the intention. Will upgrade review and star level when shown improvement."
coinbase,ios,altairscreed1191,1,2022-10-18 11:19:29,"So like the title says I’ve had Coinbase for over a year and am just sort of iffy about it . I think the only reason I still use it is to buy coins quick to transfer to my ledger. I don’t trust them and the info they give to the government which totally defeats the purpose of crypto, their fees are kinda expensive and annoying!! They are 100% ripping you off on the APY for cryptos such as Eth ,Ada, and more  basically halving your interest amount. They crypto availability is okay but not great and a friendly reminder that if they go bankrupt your crypto is gone and they receive your money . Coinbase one is a joke and way overpriced for what it is and your money should be safe in Coinbase anyway which says a lot about them as a company and how safe your money really is . The only saving grace is their ceo (who i like a lot ) the ease of sending crypto, and the fact they are popular enough that I  doubt they go bankrupt like voyager or Celsius ( but it could happen) . Overall be vigilant about this company and just make sure when you buy your crypto to transfer it to a hard wallet if you wanna secure your crypto."
coinbase,ios,Bryan Hry,5,2017-12-05 02:49:00,"I have been sitting on a bunch of coins for a year now and since it hit $11k per coin recently, I decided it’s time to sell some. I did a lot of research before choosing Coinbase and they seemed to have the best user reviews of all the US based Bitcoin services. The setup was very easy and selling was incredibly easy. Anyone who has tried to sell Bitcoin in the past will tell you, selling the coins was not only overwhelming, but also difficult. Coinbase has changed all that. I have sold coins with both the website and the app, and surprisingly, the iPhone app is actually easier use and offers a better user experience. I would definitely recommend this app to anyone interested in buying/selling Bitcoin!

Unrelated, I would highly recommend you enable MFA (Multi Facet Authentication) which adds a second layer of authenticating when logging into the app. This helps prevent unauthorized access as Bitcoin wallets are a prime target for hackers."

I needed to make I needed make a withdrawal and send 1,200 dollars worth of assets to Nexo in order to leverage a loan. And as you would expect, the delayed it 72 hours for security purposes. That was frustrating. But then again they give you the option to accelerate your request with photo verification.... Well, even if you’re already verified, you need to verify it AGAIN just for that single request! What kind of BS is that? Well it gets worse. No matter how many times you put in your documents, it skips over the selfie option and automatically fails your attempt. 

No matter what I do, how many times I try, they fail my attempts. Fine. Fine! So after that I canceled my larger request and went with a much smaller 400 dollar withdrawal to another address. 

AND THEY FROZE IT AGAIN!! 

Tell me, what is the point of a digital economy if the platforms we trust to facilitate payments is as slow as central banking? Coinbase is no longer meeting my needs as a consumer and I will be very soon looking for another exchange that’s going to give me tools that make my job simpler and that I can trust to not screw me over and hold my funds just for the hell of it.

I invested about $100 but it’s unfortunate that these people do not care who they’re doing what to. I am a single mom and literally was just trying to jump on the train of returns and it’s not even the dip that’s screwing me but the actual company. I honestly wouldn’t recommend investing in this app at all. They don’t even have customer service. And I have PLENTY of receipts. Just because of the way they are going about the situation Im not letting this go. Too many people invest in these apps and imagine if 400K of the 1.4 million who just REVIEWED the app put in $5-$250 and can’t even get their money back!!!!????? Some people even invest $1000s.

I find it quite funny they where quick to go public selling stocks yet the company has 0 and when I say zero I mean zero customer support they advertise on so many platforms and if you check all their comments it’s full of people with situations exactly like mine 100% don’t recommend this app or services unless you want to give them free money as they lock your money and won’t respond about unlocking your account stating “we have larger than usual support request and may take some time to respond” it’s been a year I guess the two guys running it are just stealing money from customers and not offering any help honestly about to report them to BBB for fraud…

I contacted my bank and it is not maxed out in my account. I chatted with a virtual assistant and when that work  I chatted with 3 agents all of whom stated they complely understood my issues and would get me started. I was only buying $200 at this time. All of them sounded condescending with the completely understanding. None of them could tell me why my card was declined or maxed out. All three totally failed. Then in total frustration with your site I asked how do I close the account. The agent sent me a 4 or 5 paragraph list to close the account telling me to clean everything out. They knew I was not successful buying anything or transferring any money into the account. Th agent asked me for more verification including a picture identification. When I asked why I needed a picture identification like a passport they said it was for security purposes. But could not tell me why the card was maxed out.

That’s where the whole things goes sideways, having got the account opens and verified, I transferred funds from my personal account. The funds where verified as having left my account and it took well over a week before you confirmed it as readily available to use whilst trading. Next problem, at watching the market to buy in at the right price for me and sell at the right point, Bitcoin suspends trading!. Your fees for transactions are down right insane and day light robbery. You have zero customer service and never get back to anyone. You do not have a direct number customer service number. You’re excuse for suspended trading due to high volume of trades or customer interest is a joke.

I wanted to place an order but I couldn’t because the entire UI was frozen. You really need to address this issue asap. This is unacceptable. 
More importantly, I was not able to provide any feedback because you do NOT have any way for users to provide feedback. I would probably do not write this review if I was able to communicate with someone. Obviously your UI monitoring isn’t good enough to pick up issues like this. Regardless, you MUST provide a way for your users to provide feedback. By the way - that help chat you have on your site is useless.

Now I have lost all my gains by not being able to sell when prices were up high. Absolutely just highway robbery and they charge you an arm and a leg for fees to move your money around if you actually can move it.

Worst off, all I get in responses is the generic “please reinstall the app” or “reset your phone”.  It took over a month to even get that response from Coinbase.

I disputed the charge with my bank and Coinbase and was refunded the extra transfer amount. However, a few days later Coinbase sent me an email stating they were going to collect the debt to them in 15 days from my current balance (coins I had previously purchased). So I emailed them literally 7 times and opened cases which were never resolved and they didn’t help me but they still closed each case stating the issue was resolved.

They literally stole my money. I am reporting them to the better business bureau and their customer support is non existent so please refrain from using this platform.

I am signed up to make periodic deposits/payments automatically to invest more funds via my debit card, yet I cannot make a deposit payment into my checking account? It does not really make sense that the app can take payments from me but I cannot withdraw funds. This is problematic, and makes me hesitant about investing more funds using the app, which is a shame because that is obviously what I want to do. One of the crypto-currencies supported by the app is designed to make it easier for people to send and receive money.

During app setup, the user is prompted to set up two-factor authentication via SMS (the only option available). SMS is not a secure 2FA medium. Hackers and scammers have several tools in their arsenals by which SMS messages can be intercepted, socially engineered, or faked. SIM swapping attacks are a good example of this. This exposes end users to the potential loss of their crypto-currencies, while believing they are ""secure"". As a better form of security, Coinbase should add support for both hardware (yubikey etc.) and software authenticator apps to better secure users' crypto assets. In the meantime, users should use all, or a combination of the following: Use a UNIQUE/strong password for this application (ideally generated by a password manager) that is used nowhere else. Set up a PIN or additional security with their mobile provider. Use an offline hardware device like the Ledger Nano X to store crypto currencies when not actively trading or transferring assets."

I know this because I just spent 20 minutes on the phone with customer service and they were very knowledgeable and very polite and very helpful

I do a lot of business with Fidelity. They have a completely different platform with similar sales incentives, and I strongly recommend an encourage at this point Coinbase for limit purchasing and sales

So now it has been 11 days and they still won’t release the funds so I can transfer it back to my bank account. I have no idea why they need to hold my money this long. I am sure it has long been deposited into their account because my account was debited 11 days ago. I am very frustrated that they are preventing me from getting money back that belongs to me.

coinbase,ios,Kevin_NYC resident,1,2020-12-08 16:23:00,If you want to entrust investing in an crypto app that has absolutely zero support when issues go wrong then Coinbase is the place to go. Since the world of investing in crypto is new there can be growing pains. I mistakingly sent a transaction to an email address instead of a wallet and attempts to get corrected are abysmal. The FAQ’s say if a mistake was made wait 30 days for a reversal and if still not rectified contact support. There’s the rub...You have to email support and finding the right tree structure for this type of problem was difficult. Post submitting my email I got a resolution reply from Coinbase noting my ticket was closed. 2 more attempts to get corrected through this email channel available all resulted in the same automatic closing of my ticket. I assume they auto close without a human ever even reading and reaching out to me to resolve. No way to resolve my issue and if you try to call the posted 888 number they only will let you speak to a live person if you think you have a security breach. The regulators hopefully will review their practices but until they evolve stay away.

It’s been weeks, I still am locked out with no answers. I’ve submitted an official complaint via the Coinbase website but still haven’t heard anything. I even reached out to u/coinbasesupport via Reddit, they didn’t respond to me either. Zero stars simply because of customer service. I have a big bag of crypto sitting on a locked Coinbase account, with no one to talk with or contact about it. It’s sickening. I have zero control of what’s going on. I plan to take legal action if they continue to ignore my official complaint since there is a time frame that they are obliged to respond by.

The history of my transfers  suggested the same, yet my Coinbase portfolio was higher for the amount of $130. The same amount was showing being transferred on my bank account. I am 100% positive that I never initiated that amount. It took about two weeks for the amount to become available so I could transfer it back to my bank. That was strange and I guess it will remain mystery. Secondly, it doesn’t show clear (or not at all actually) how much we are in gain or loss for each crypto we own. Also, when we go to “profile” page, it shows cryptos that we don’t own. It’s just disappointing all around. I guess now I’m stuck with it as I don’t wanna be selling my crypto, especially not now when it all crashed, but I am not happy with this app at all."

2. It doesn’t take 7 days to verify assets. 
3. Above makes web3 a frustrating experience because fees on transactions alone will render your web3 wallet useless for a week unless your asset value exceeds your deposit amount and only then can you only make a purchase for the difference. 
4. If you’re going to have dapp support, considering all the other little lessons you give people, I think it would be beneficial for others if you could explain gas fees and what swaps will potentially require in your wallet. Considering the cost of etherium and popularity on defi coins i can only imagine how many inquiries you get from your customers as to why they can’t swap $2300 worth of assets or why $150 was burned in etherium for a $85 swap. Not your responsibility but save people from learning the hard way. Just a thought"
coinbase,ios,Sorce of corse,2,2020-04-20 08:19:01,"I’ve been using Coinbase for over a month and have made a number of trades.  Reading some of the reviews prompted this one.  Where exactly is all the money from the high fees going if the company hasn’t even bothered setting up a proper customer service channel??  I haven’t personally had any issues with the UI of the app but I have also not tried to withdraw funds from the app (and will be upset if I’m charged a fee to have to wait two weeks to have access to my money) so I can’t comment on that.  

What I can comment on is the high fees for sub par service.  Because I am wondering what exactly those fees are paying for.  The charts and info available are very limited and the prices when you go to buy, sell, and I’m wanting to say even convert raises an eyebrow on occasion.  

I wasn’t planning on withdrawing my money from Coinbase for the foreseeable future, but after using it for a month, I will be looking into better options and take it from there.  But yeah, it’s pretty bad that Coinbase doesn’t have some kind of call center for customer service."

I’ve written to customer support, but they referred me to a help article, which provided basic instructions on submitting an ID. Clearly, submitting an ID is not an issue, when your stupid system doesn’t recognize it. What’s annoying, it took Coinbase about a week to come back to me with this canned response; you would think one week would be enough to come up with a personalized response with details as to why the system can’t recognize my ID.

coinbase,ios,trav2324,1,2024-07-09 04:19:24,"I would like to give them 0 stars. I bought crypto on their exchange and was charged but didn’t receive the crypto. I have spent nearly two weeks trying to get a resolution for an error caused by their system. I have been told I need to wait close to 5 weeks  now, after being told 7 days initially, for their review process to complete even though they can see I was charged and did not receive the crypto I ordered.

I have probably spoken to 20 of their support team members to even get to this point. No one from Coinbase has reached out or even seems to care about their system essentially stealing money from me aside from the copy pasta support team messages. I would say beware and if you have any issues just be ready for them to put any burden on you even if it is caused by their faults. 

They are not a reputable exchange and should be used with caution, they are doing shady business the exact way that hurts crypto adoption. I hope anyone that finds this message will take a second look and do business with a better more competent exchange."
coinbase,ios,Austxxn,4,2021-12-24 05:25:14,"As a new user of Coinbase I was really excited to see the vast number of cryptocurrencies available on the platform. Right away I began trading and everything was very easy to navigate. The platform is visually pleasing, easy to use and get started, and also offers a wide selection of coins to trade from. 

My only complaint is that there is no (easy) way to see how much I’ve gained or lost since the time of purchase. What I mean by this is that on other trading apps when you buy a coin/stock you are able to immediately see how much the value has increased or decreased which gives you a good indication of when to sell and how to track gains and losses. 

Unless I am mistaken, the Coinbase app doesn’t offer this feature. You can see the current price of the asset and how much it has gone up within a specific time frame and your current balance in local currency as well as the conversion amount (e.g. 
         $512
          0.01 BTC
)

I would really like to see Coinbase add another drop down option on the “Your Assets” page that shows exactly how much the value of each asset has changed since the original purchase as well as its current value. 

(E.g.
 
Bitcoin           $50,000   <— current price
                     +$1,000     <— change in value since time of purchase

)

I hope this finds the right person or team. 

Cheers!"

coinbase,ios,tmcbride123,2,2021-11-18 00:51:43,Sadly their fees are ridiculously high. I was trading on Robinhood for free and very happy.  I wanted to buy Solana and Robinhood did not offer it so I went to Coinbase.   I then thought I would use this app and company to handle my crypto trades.  They charge high fees when buying and converting cash to crypto or crypto to cash. Also if you trade one crypto for another they ding you too even though they advertise they don’t charge for exchanging crypto. Seems to me they are basically like some of the big banks just interested in making money charging you for fees for everything. Things are not very transparent either.  For example trying to calculate your gains and losses is not possible on the app. You have to track your purchase price vs the market prices. Robinhood makes this very easy so it can be done but feels like Coinbase just wants to keep you in the dark on whether you are making money or losing your shirt.  It’s very burdensome to manage your investments in my opinion. I am looking for a new trading platform.
coinbase,ios,Team O'Malley,1,2025-01-12 00:29:17,"I got duped into signing up for this app from a friend. I paid for their upgrade of $35/month for what was perceived to be unlimited trades. What I failed to learn until later is that it’s unlimited trades up to $10K worth of trades. So if you have larger funds or want to make multiple trades you’re done. They charge approx a 1% spread so your underwater as soon as you make your trade, then they charge you approx a 2% upfront fee. So for example, let’s say you feel a coin is going to pump. If you buy the coin 3% in spread and fees, the. You sell the coin 3% in spread and fees and God forbid you buy it back 3% in spread and fees. So you’d be out 9% in that scenario. Good luck finding good enough trades to justify paying that much on your trades. When I reached out to customer care to tell them I had unlimited trades they informed me that there was a $10k cap and then trades go back to full fees. When I asked for a refund they told me to kick rocks. I liquidated my account and I’ll take my business to Kraken. Don’t waste your time! They’re rip off artists."

Now I have a considerable amount of money in a cryptocurrency, subject to its volatility, that I cannot use for the purpose that I purchased it. This is unacceptable and doesn’t make sense. If it’s for security purposes, then why does coinbase allow me to purchase the cryptocurrency immediately but does not allow me to use it? Of course I can always sell the cryptocurrency back to USD but for every transaction there is a significant fee that I have to pay. Cannot possibly recommend this app!"

The instructions are complicated and I have no confidence, even if can decipher them, that this will resolve the problem. The support people are often not very fluent in English, which makes the situation even more frustrating . Today one of the customer service employees just hung up on me when they could not answer my questions or solve my problem. No wonder their stock is dropping like a rock. Dealing with Coinbase is way too hard and takes the fun out of trying to trade crypto currencies. They  are treating me like a security risk who is trying to break into my account, instead of an actual customer with a tech problem locking him out of his own account. I am no tech expert and sadly Coinbase is making it difficult or impossible to access my own account on my computer. Crazy way to run a company!"
coinbase,ios,23jours,1,2021-04-27 18:20:41,The data you want to evaluate your investment is just not there. For example in Robinhood - it tells you how much you have made or lost each day on your investment and it tells you how much in total you have lost or made on that invest since your first transaction. You can create separate lists just for your investments in Robinhood. The transactions take FOREVER to finalize- which is really insane since this is supposedly based off a blockchain and it should be instantaneous! You get notified days and days later that a transaction has finally gone through when you thought it had days beforehand. It appeared that it had because the money was “available” but apparently technically it wasn’t yet. They just fronted you the money. It becomes very confusing when you are a moderate to heavy trader. I wish I could say there is a better app for this but none of them are user friendly. If you want to trade certain cryptos then you have to use certain apps. There is no app that does them all so at least for now this app is a necessary evil.

Make sure to read about everything that you buy and all rules regarding particular transactions. Not all are the same. Furthermore, the deals and trades they offer are fair, and sometimes better than what you would see on something like CoinMarketCap. If a coin is listed on Coinbase, I will usually find that the price is better or more up to date on here versus something like CoinMarketCap. However just remember to only buy what you would be willing to lose or go a long time without!
On another note, my only issue thus far is that I have never been told whether I won or did not win during any of their sweepstakes. If they could communicate that to me, it would be a 6-star review!"

They can't answer BASIC questions & after speaking to several different people it seems supplementing their ignorance with rudeness is a company policy. I am moving my assets to another exchange. 
As long as your account is fine & you have no issues, concerns, questions coinbase is fine. The minute you have to contact them you will probably conclude that your money is safer elsewhere. & It's fine to have customer service representatives to answer basic questions but there should be people knowledgeable about crypto to speak to when you have significant money invested with a company.

So as someone you use your service I do and many other also have assets stored with you and we will highly appreciate if any developers and at least buckle down on the connection issues. At least if you want good standing with community I love your interface but blow your competitors out of the water by ironing the issues that are dangerous like being in a trade and having a connection error is scary.

This app lets you simply transfer money to your account using one of several methods and buy what you want quickly. I use the transfer via PayPal which is extremely easy and fast. It also has an easy to read display and a not confusing or complicated like the other apps. 

One recommendation for the developer would be to not start off asking for info when I first download and open the app. Let me see the app and features  first to feel comfortable with it, then let’s talk about my personal details. I understand they are required by law to invest, but having to hand them out before I even know I want to use your app made me feel uncomfortable and not wanting to proceed."

We have come a long way since the 1970s, and so has our money. The US dollar is not money. It is a debt based currency that the “Federal” Reserve has practically printed into extinction. Many Crypto currencies on the other hand, meet the definition of “money,” just as gold and other items that store value. 

Coinbase is very user friendly. Especially for GenX. While it took some time to learn how to use it, CoinBase offered “free” cyrpto as an incentive. Once I was on the exchange, I discovered that it is easy to buy and sell tokens, send them to any of my private wallets, or despots my earnings as USD back into my bank acct. 

A couple of things I want to note. 
Coinbase is compliant with all state and federal regulations, and keep a track record for your CPA. 
Coinbase offers incentives to hold your money by staking tokens such as Solana, Ethereum, and even USDC, and the APR is much better than any bank I know of currently operating in the US. 
While I have had my technological challenges, their customer service has been very helpful in helping me resolve them in a timely manner. 
I very rarely wrote reviews anymore, but Coinbase has earned it.

I’ve gone through each step their website offers to try to resolve the issue, but they simply left the account as is, unverified, and said it’s been resolved. They never reached out for any further clarification. In their FAQ section, it turns out they don’t really have a remedy for this situation, but essentially have shrugged off responsibility and tell their customers that if they’re in my situation, they’re simply out of luck.

Coinbase has been solid for me. I have access to most of what I want to trade, and there’s plenty of ultra fast tokens here to buy and send off to a wallet for swaps. 

I use xlm because it’s accepted everywhere, super fast, has ultra low fees, and is practically a stable coin at $.10! So it feels like a good bang for your buck right off the bat! Just don’t buy into a peak and hold into a valley. You’ll see

Tips:

Don’t store the bulk of your crypto on any exchange. Not your keys, not your crypto is real

Figure out what you want, what wallets support it, and do the research on a good cold storage setup

Factory direct is the only “safe” way to purchase a cold storage wallet. Inspect all packaging and devices for any irregularities. If sus, arrange a return/exchange

Find a good hot wallet (internet wallet) and keep a small/medium bag there for quick trades, purchases, and cash outs

Follow your wallets, exchanges, crypto projects, regulatory agencies, & current heads of state/agency on social media

Check your bags often

Be aware

Coinbase has a division called Know You Customer which starts asking for proof of where you get the funds from, they request payment slips, income statements, retirement income etc, etc and never stop asking for more, in the meantime they restrict your account and all you can do is see your balance,  with a pop up sign stating that your money is “safe in Coinbase”.  I have been requesting them to close my account and transfer my money back but all they reply is “your account is under review”.

To make matters worse, the identification method they have in place doesn't even work properly. After spending a significant amount of time trying to comply with their demands, it's clear that this is nothing but a waste of time. It's frustrating to see that Coinbase seems completely indifferent to the inconvenience and potential risks they're subjecting their users to.

It's disheartening that a platform dealing with financial transactions and sensitive data isn't taking the necessary steps to ensure a secure environment. Given the increasing importance of online privacy, Coinbase's cavalier attitude towards user data is simply unacceptable.

On the app level: the UI seems to deteriorate over time. Whereas back when coinbase would only support 2/3 cryptos it was easy to see their trends and easy to see where the market is going, now all the relevant information is hidden behind a bunch of clicks. An attempt to mimic Robinhood with some information about the coin and news also takes up room from what could be potentially more interesting info.

From focusing on democraticizing crypto Coinbase has moved onto a get rich quick investing platform at detriment of their customers. Unfortunately people still have to use it because of lack of decent competition, but I‘m sure this will change soon if they continue to ignore their users."

Thankfully there are other places where this information is available however not having clear visibility on the asset prices and their latest development makes it very difficult to plan without using another reference.

They have a third party vendor named Plaid and they just say “give us your bank account credentials” (full access to your bank account) I’m not giving that to anyone. if you have any understanding of online security measures then this is a nonstarter. After you decline this you get prompted to add the bank account the regular way (routing and account number) but when you click submit it instantly tells you: verification failed use a different bank. This means they didn’t even try, it would take at least five seconds to verify with your bank. Maybe they are still building out this feature or it only works with corporate banks and not credit unions but it’s disappointing. I signed up for the premium service Coinbase One and spoke to support on the phone. They said the only two options are to use Plaid or manually verification which does not work."

coinbase,ios,ThatOneGuyThatForgotHisName,4,2022-05-10 21:55:24,"I believe ALGO staking is done since April unless you sign up for it which your platform, Coinbase, doesn't have. 
I've been using Coinbase since February of 2021. The hidden fees were a trip trying to figure out around that time. Yes I'm glad you all decided to show how much it'll be for the network fee. I'm not a fan of the other hidden fee that most people who are just starting out may not even know about. Coinbase should state how much it'll be to transfer one crypto to the other before hitting the submit button. 

I've also seen a lot of great changes but some changes were making me think someone must have been really toasted while programming. 

For those out there who should know, try to not use your real cell phone number. Years ago it was about hiding your ss number. Now it's about your phone number. Use something like MySudo and use that free number only for this platform. 
I read through the comments and see people say they've been getting hack while having such and such amount of dollars. Do you really trust this company with that amount of money? Look into cold storage wallets and hodl on those. 

I rate this app 4/5 because it's still a great app. Easy to understand for the most part when starting out. 

Keep up the great work and listen to your customers. Thank you"

Accidentally selected deposit instead of withdraw. Funds weren’t in my checking account, (hence withdrawing my crypto, cuz, emergency). Now there’s a hold on my account but they credited me with the USD I didn’t have the funds for. Can’t access my crypto until I make a payment. If I don’t they are just going to take my funds. Asked if I could designate the source of the repayment be the USD I didn’t mean to deposit, nor did I have the funds to deposit, nope. So now I might have to pay with my crypto which would count as a trade, which I’ll have to pay capital gains tax on some of it. Dirtbags and robbers. (Or at the very least, incompetent). (FYI I didn’t take my frustration out on the customer service). I’m certainly furious with the company. Avoid them at all cost. Use that other big trading platform. (Unless your in NYS of course).

coinbase,ios,Kimberglock,1,2021-02-28 16:10:39,I opened a checking account specifically to fund my Coinbase account. I transferred money into this account as well as depositing cash. I made 8 purchases through Coinbase . Then the problems began . Problem one My bank froze my account because they didn’t recognize the transfer . I fixed that problem but it was too late . Then Coinbase began reversing the purchases . Yes I was trying to make the payments but now they would not accept my bank account . There is ZERO customer support from Coinbase . They shouldn’t be allowed to do business if they cannot help their customers. So then 2 of my purchases went through as I was able to fix things on my end . Well those purchases where then stolen from my account by Coinbase and I have not received a refund or any support as to what is happening. My free crypto that I earned was also taken from my account . I doubt I will ever be able to get any help from Coinbase . They basically say you can’t call us and we probably won’t be able to help you if anything goes wrong . I would not recommend this company .

Now that I'm back using the app, the software is great (I'm a software dev myself, so I love to see what big budget apps like this CA do). Three things popped out

 ----2024 UI/UX 
9/10 

Original and elegant without be unintuitive. Missing details like minute candels for traders but not the poiint. 
-2017: 6/10 was basically a poor responsive design port of the website then. 

----2024 Performance/Stability 
10/10

It's so nice to see all the common laggy use cases ACTUALLY WORK as fast as they were originally intended.  They app is never the shortcoming or slow chain in the link of tech than tells me how much I can sell x for $$.

-2017: 2/10 Single Sign On alone was hard, toggling airplane mode was commonly a ""fix"" for laggy transactions 

-2024 Custodial wallet features: 6/10. Good support for normal use cases. Poor support for things like multiple addresses per coin/network.  Also wallet only competitors for the mess that is  bridging coins vs swapong, but this was -never it's core use case 
2017: 3/10.. hard to even receive a crypto coin then

-Trading platform features: I'm  not qualified to review, but cool."

The Kraken team as they call themselves, keeps tripping over each other even though they all work from home I was told. They have no business being in the business that they’re in. They’re absolutely clueless. But then I come. Coin Base and there’s just no comparison to Coin Base’s superior. They know what to do.

I followed the steps concerning not having access to old phone. It still asked old phone to be verified. Phone service would not put me through with verifying old phone. I then emailed service and was told to do what I have already tried. After explaining that, I was told to go create a new account with a new email and submit info with my ID so Coinbase can determine if they will allow me access to update my phone on old account. The whole time, we are emailing from the email on my current account. A whole lot of trouble I do not have time for. When a phone number is changed, why do these companies expect you to keep the old number active?
These types of apps and services have become available at a dime a dozen. Find you one that has real customer service with an actual rep. Imagine if I had set this up to handle all of my money and ended up in this situation! My money would be gone!!!!"
coinbase,ios,JNROBINS,1,2022-03-29 13:01:42,"I have used Coinbase for several years. Recently, however, the app glitched during a purchase and accidentally made a duplicate purchase. I was unable to do anything about it so reached out to support. There is no one live you can talk to so I was forced to submit my request and wait for an email correspondence. Even though I submitted very thorough documentation outlining exactly what happened (which included two simultaneous transactions that could not have possibly both been initiated by me), I was tossed around from several different people over email who continued to misunderstand the situation. After 2.5weeks of back and forth emails, I received no resolution and then Coinbase sold the duplicate transaction (again without authorization or warning), but at a significant loss since BTC had crashed. All said, 2 unauthorized transactions, terrible customer support, and a ~$4000 loss all because of Coinbase’s incompetency.

coinbase,ios,Jesseondrums,1,2021-10-11 16:47:56,"My original review discussed the shady tactics they employ as you’ll read among other reviewers- inaccurate prices, purchasing at higher prices then they’re currently listed at. Selling at lower prices than what’s listed plus they charge you for transfers and deposits. 
Their response to my review was “we recommend you look at our purchase policies” basically saying, we’re allowed to be shady, we wrote it in the million word fine print. 
That’s a little update to the old stuff now the new:
Sold my shares and withdrew my funds to be deposited in my bank. That was two weeks ago. It says it was done but the money is not in my account and my account was disconnected from Coinbase. So now I have to contact them to get this rectified. 
Save yourself the time, money and head ache. Use something else. Most people don’t see the small discrepancies or they don’t experience then yet because they are selling or withdrawing. I don’t trust them and I wish I read through all of the reviews before I risked my money like I did"

After using this app for about a month now trying to make some profit I finally found that by using this App I am losing on every transaction. They took so much money from you when you buy, when you sell, & when you withdraw to your bank account. Therefore, I decided that when the market go up for little bit I will move all my money out to another App. I just wanna return the money I have started with then no longer gonna use you greedy service. I just need to tell the developer & the owner that: You’re using the People who trusted you, it doesn’t make any scene that you makes so much money and other traders makers nothing. You’re taking our profit and the equation is win/lose not win/win.

coinbase,ios,2FA camera deficient,5,2025-01-25 22:46:15,My app suddenly stoped allowing access to my account and will not access my camera for 2FA access.  The camera isn’t even a selectable option when viewing the app in the i-phone settings.  My wallet works and does allow me to select access to the camera (turn on and off as I want to). Since the app cannot access the camera the Authenticator app can’t log me into my Coinbase account. Maybe having face recognition isn’t better than a pin key.  The phone is running the most recent software version.  The app has been deleted and reinstalled several times and the phone has been rebooted several time.  This is without a doubt an app issue.  I have contacted and worked with Apple Support who asked me to work with the app developers.

However, in an effort to maintain their reputation they go way above and beyond to make it extremely difficult to buy crypto. Once you finally have an account set up and linked to your bank account, it severely limits the amount you are allowed to purchase at one time, and the reason why is completely arbitrary. They literally just make up numbers based on their algorithm. If you try talking to customer service, be prepared for the biggest waste of time. I spent hours speaking with people who had no idea what they were doing or how to explain even the simplest things. Then my transaction was failed with no explanation even though it was under the daily limit. No matter how many times you ask, they will never let you speak with a supervisor or anyone that has any level of competency. I’ve lost out on thousands of dollars in potential investment returns thanks to coinbase."

However, since last week, as the market began to rise, I bought some coins using my bank account and paid a $4 fee per transaction, which is ridiculously expensive. Suddenly, my account is under review. I can’t sell, deposit cash, or transfer funds.

I contacted customer support, and since I didn’t have Coinbase One, I waited in line for 2 hours, but no one helped. After paying $30 for Coinbase One, support finally contacted me. However, all they could say was that my account is under review without providing any reason. They told me to wait for an email.

If you do some research online, a lot of people are experiencing the same thing. I don’t expect this can be solved for another months. Don’t use this platform, they can lock you money for months without any explanation. I just hope I can transfer my fund and close the account as soon as possible."
coinbase,ios,DigitalTemerity,5,2021-07-28 21:39:50,"Coinbase is an app for iOS and other OSs that is also an Internet based wallet you can keep your funds in or transfer it to your hardware wallet.  It is also available as a website.

Coinbase is so much more than just a simple exchange though.  It offers individualized charts of your portfolio including charts of individual currencies and up-to-date pricing charts for many popular currencies.

It also keeps you updated on the latest news articles from authoritative sources updated on an hourly basis.  Coinbase charges fees scaled on the amount of cash you spend and allows you to use PayPal.  I usually buy $26 allotments of currency at a fee of $1.49.  You can buy up to $50 for $1.99.  So the more you spend the less you pay in fees but I am simply an enthusiast.

I see the potential of crypto currency and want a piece of it.  I dabble with it at the moment to see how I do and then down the road who knows.  I never ever invest money I can’t afford to lose, so no harm to me if the bottom falls out of the market however disappointing that may be.  I am careful to diversify my holdings and buy from more than one exchange.  Coinbase however is definitely the most informative and useful exchange I use."

Edit July 2023: Your current Recurring buys page on the app is also gone which showed all the current recurring buys one currently has set up which is yet another downgrade, hence I’m taking another star off.

Locked me out of my acount and froze my assets at a critical time making me loose even more money. My bank had to sort it out for me they where that stubborn about it.

Don’t be fooled by other reviews on here … I have an online business and I know how to get 5 star reviews… and as to their response? Iv gone threw customer service with them before. Doesn’t work. That’s why I had my bank take back the money for me cus they refused….

coinbase,ios,Nik2️⃣1️⃣7️⃣,1,2022-03-28 12:41:36,"Overall, I really enjoyed using Coinbase. It is extremely easy to use and they don’t seem to charge too much on fees. However, after having my money basically stolen by Coinbase due to the “We’re having connection issues” screen that pops up every time I want to look at my funds or transfer money, I guarantee that you do not want to use this app. Upon doing my due diligence and looking for a solution, I found out that this is an unresolved issue dating back TWO YEARS. There are people who never found a solution and have been continuously ignored by Coinbase support. If they can resolve this issue I would have no problem changing my review, but more people need to be made aware of this issue because it seems like this is just out of negligence on Coinbase’s part.

Edit: I forgot to mention that coinbase has the worst customer service. The only way you can contact them is through a live messaging app. No phone number, no email, just you “texting” support to try and fix your problem."
coinbase,ios,skreidler22,1,2021-12-08 18:35:15,I recently joined coinbase about a month ago. Since then ive had multiple problems with the app and ive tried contacting coinbase but they have the worst customer service out there. Waited on hold for about 2 hours on a Wednesday morning. Given it said estimated wait time was 35 minutes. Tried using there online customer service on there webpage and it was no help as well. Finally got through to someone on the phone and the gentlemen that helped me was very polite (Name: Owen). He was not able to help with my problem and just connected me to another hold line. Waited again on hold for about another 40 minutes before I just gave up. In total wasted about 4 hours of my day trying to fix this problem and in conclusion nothing came of it. This is why I will be swithcing to an alternative platform. I STRONGLY RECOMMEND all others to do so as well. Just very disapointed with the app so far and I hope they use this information to improve their services.
coinbase,ios,SprintAdam,2,2021-02-13 01:57:18,"Interface is easy to use and very easy to become accommodated with the functions. However, I used the referral link to invite my roommate who then followed the requirement of purchasing $100 worth of crypto (they purchased $105 actually) and over 6 weeks later, neither of us has received the $10 in free Stellar Lumens. I’ve emailed support 3 times now and only get an automated reply saying they’re receiving too many emails and responses may be delayed. At the time, XLM was around $.24 a token and they’re currently sitting at $.57. $10 or $20 may not be a lot, but it’s the principle. It’s good business to honor that which you advertise. Since this dilemma, I’ve started using Gemini and Exodus more often. They have honored their referral rewards so I believe they may be more honest and appreciative of the business on their platform. Hoping this is eventually resolved, but I suppose time will tell. Make sure you only invest what you’re willing to lose! But there are other, more honest and sincere exchanges and wallets."

Impossible to verify your bank account because it has an error every 5 seconds. Asked me to verify my license by sending a picture, which I did, and it came back with an error. Unable to verify my bank account by my account number and routing number, which are correct, but instead it just gives me error messages. Now I have money in here that I can deposit back into my bank account. They had no problem verifying my identity and my bank account when I was depositing money, but now that I want to withdraw there are all kinds of hoops to jump through that the app can’t even process. I don’t think I’ve ever actually left a review on the App Store until now, that’s how much this app has angered me. Developers need to figure it out. And until they do, you need to use a different service instead. I switched all of my stuff over to CashApp and it works much better than this garbage. I’d give it 0 stars if I could.

The next day, I thought oh it’s a new day I will add some more money.  I got a very weird error that was not clear at all. I retried several times to see if the error would go away and my transaction would go through. They then lowered my daily limit to where now I can barely add money onto my Coinbase account. Because the DAILY limit is a 7 DAY LIMIT… but they don’t tell you that anywhere.. they definitely drop the ball in several places. Also if you want to get a hold of a real person you need to call customer support on the card services side of Coinbase because anywhere else is stupid chat support and they give you general answers to your serious problems."
coinbase,ios,Derek737,5,2020-01-05 01:20:29,"Great and easy to use app for trading any type of crypto. Definitely seems to be one of the more popular versions as well for good reason. Although I would lower the fees a bit. Even if other apps charge high fees as well, it would be nice if they take the route that other investment banks have taken lately to offer zero to very low fees for trades. Another piece of constructive criticism I must give though would be for the app to better explain in detail what your net gain is compared to the amount of money you have invested. That way your not just looking at a broad percentage between all your currencies or having to sit and do the math yourself based on how much I’ve invested verses it’s current value of each individual one. Other then that it’s great! 👍 and I highly recommend for anyone interested in trading bitcoin or any other crypto."
coinbase,ios,RMS1983,4,2021-05-16 13:33:46,I’ve been using this app for 2 months. I like the learning about crypto when being gifted by Coinbase. As the information about the new coins or some projects are very interesting to learn about. If the developers would add a night mode and better tracking charts or options to see red and green candles or live graphs. I would give this app a 5 star rating. They continue to list more  coins. I just can’t see all coins listed when I type some alt coins in. Also some coins aren’t tradable. I do like the coins listed. But coinbase seems to have a limit of value. They don’t list anything lower than .12. Please just do the community a favor add night mode and better charts. Also CoinTracker linking is very useful. They do charge fees and I find them fair for the amount I buy.
coinbase,ios,casual coun guy,2,2021-01-25 02:49:03,"Its an easy to use app but there are a few issues that have made me not like this app as much as I did at first.

First and foremost is while monitoring ETH I “traded” at 1395, selling 5 ETH for USD. On the sales report it said the trade price was $1381 A 14$ DIFFERENCE! I sit there and refresh the price constantly, and it hadn’t been $1381 for at least 5 minutes. So getting jilted out of $14 x 5 coins plus their high fees ate up almost 20% of my trade. Thats after fees just to buy coins too. Not very impressed and kind of sketchy if you ask me. 

Next is an interface issue. When you want to put your USD$ back into your linked bank acct you have to select the “withdraw” option instead of the “deposit” option. You are withdrawing the cash from the app acct back into your bank acct and a deposit pulls money out of your bank and deposits it into your app acct. This unclear wording made me nearly overdraw and even worse, since it takes my bank a few days to process the transaction (both withdraw and deposit), I had no access to my money for over a week which was frustrating. 

Another issue is the fees themselves. Very high if you’re trying to do times trades. 

Last issue off the top of my head is the lack of Monero trading. 

Its a good app for beginners who just want to learn I suppose but I’m a bit disappointed in the discrepancy between my sale trade price and their reported sale trade price which seemed dishonest."

coinbase,ios,OnlyTheTruth1278,1,2025-02-24 21:14:10,"Between the promos not working and the fees on everything I wouldn’t even give this 1 star, mostly because of false advertising promotions. Since the promotions do not work once everything has been done and you get the notification stating the requirements are met this would be considered false advertising. The reward wasn’t provided and also since I have tried going through the app and there is no way to get legitimate help from a representative they clearly do not care about customer service. Much work is needed as your word to customers should be everything. Now I’m sure I’m not the only one this has happened to. The bugs need fixed right away and if you promote something be on top of it when issues occur. I am sure someone has been made aware of this as it’s been over a week since I completed everything. Principles must be upheld cause if the people can’t trust deals to be upheld why should they trust the app enough to deposit their own cash onto it."

So they sent me an email with a case number and said to communicate through that email. I have emailed them 4 times and I have not received a reply of any kind. I’ve called them 5 times and the last time I had to search for their number since the one I was using was disconnected. Each time I called they assured me that they are working on it. Still nothing. Almost two weeks now so I am convinced Coinbase is a scam. I know many whose account got wiped out on Coinbase. I Don’t know even one person who has been hacked on the other exchanges that I use. Thank God Coinbase was my 3rd smallest account. When I got scammed I had two factor I’d. A very secure password and a secure password on my email. I used finger print and Authenticator to log in. I got hacked anyway. Of course Coinbase doesn’t even try to get the crypto back. My sister got hacked last year also. It’s not a secure exchange AT ALL!!!

They charged me many times due to failed transactions maybe because of the congested traffics due to the rise of Shiba Inu. Although it’s not my fault that Shiba Inu broke the internet today. They should not charged me because of failed transactions…Just beware on using this app because they’re going to charge you higher fees even though there’s no complete transactions made. They charged me more than $200 today for nothing at all…Since nobody is answering my email and their customer service or support are all “bots” and you can’t even contact them either…I will just leave a message/review here with regards to my experience so you will not be the next victim in using this app…and hope they will return the fees incurred during those failed transactions made due to congestion or whatever!!!🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲"

I had to liquidate all my positions, suffered a great amount of fees and faults and all I can say is that I won’t leave it at there but a company claiming to be in the crypto business but is no wear near designed to have that much attention. 

Shame on them. The bureaus will be receiving my report."
coinbase,ios,papadear,1,2021-02-21 19:21:44,"I’ve had Coinbase on my phone for almost a year now, and though the fees were ridiculously high for swing trading, at least the the app was informative. After the upgrade, you can no longer see spark lines in the watch list (at least I think that’s what they’re called), and even worse, you don’t see the whole range of price for coins you’re trading anymore. By that I mean, if a certain coin is at let’s say .56, you don’t see the small changes within the cent range, such as: .5648 and so on. Now it’s just rounded up or down to the nearest cent. That’s huge if you want to make quick moves within a cent range for small gains on low priced coins! It’s like they decided “Hmmm, this app is too user friendly and we can’t screw people out of as much money now. Seems pretty sus to me. How this app still has 5 stars is a mystery to me. Read the reviews thoroughly. Its pretty clear people are frustrated too and moving to different platforms to trade. Please Bring back the old layout Coinbase!!!!"
coinbase,ios,aberjaba,1,2022-05-27 22:00:10,"coinbase is awful. i turned my phone service off and forgot that my 2fa is done through sms. and now i cant do anything with my account except for buy. turns out you dont need 2fa to buy. but youll need it for everything else. so now i have 100$ stuck on coinbase and i cant move it cash out or anything. ive tried changing my number to my moms number, but it only sends the sms verifications to the primary phone jumber which is the first one you put on there(the one i dont have access to anymore) and you need the primary number to change which phone number is your primary, so even though i updated my phone number it dosnt matter, its conpletely pointless. so i cant change my primary number without having my primary number. and so i decide to reach out to support. well if you call them they say you have to lock your account to speak with a person m, otherwise you cant talk to a real human you have to email someone. so i do that, well they apparently arent allowed to talk to customers because no matter how many times i try talking to this person im emailing, they just foraward me a copy of the faq answers on subjects that are similar to my situation. which dosnt help at all. plus ibhad already read those before emailing them. so whats the point in havng a support email if all they do is send you a picture of the faq. why not just have the faq, and not have a support email at all. its the same thing but would cost less."
coinbase,ios,Donjohndon,1,2020-06-01 04:52:47,This app could’ve been great. But I’m not going to discuss with could’ve been. The fact is they have the most horrible and I mean the worst customer service I have ever experienced in my existence. They disable me from purchasing cryptocurrency with no explanation whatsoever their customer service told me that it can take 5 to 10 business days or even more for someone to get back to me but I guess I’m on the “more” end of that process because it’s been over 3 months and no one has gotten back to me and no one responds to or answers any of my correspondences. They have no respect for the customers whatsoever I highly suggest that no one waste their time utilizing this app anymore because once something goes wrong you’re left alone to handle it. This application would have been Highly recommended by me if it was not for that one huge/great flaw.  There are many other apps to keep you away from headaches and stress which this company gives a lot of so delete and or stay away from them. Hope this helps some people.
coinbase,ios,Rack_City_Brax,1,2018-09-17 13:33:46,"So I’ve been using Coinbase for about a year and some change now and slowly it’s started to go down. I synced up my bank account because it has a higher buy per week and I’ve done this multiple times before so I went to purchase some BTC and for the first time in, let’s say 18 months, I had a 20 day fraud hold put on my purchase. I sent in help tickets and emails back and forth verifying I made the purchase, I went and verified my drivers license as well as a selfie (they requested I do it to show someone didn’t snag my license) and STILL it didn’t release. Finally one day it released and I had about 15% taken out to which they said that was due to the fluctuation of BTC cost. If they didn’t put the fraud hold on it, I would’ve had ALL of what I purchased (minus the small fee). Then today I went on to look at my balance and everything because something in my mind was telling me to look at my account and BAM the fraud hold is back on my account and I have a balance of $0 for the next 2 days....no help from customer service or the company. Kinda fed up"

Every time I speak with support either via phone or email they give me the run around. They do acknowledge there is a problem however refuse to do anything about it. I’m literally LOSING money by using these apps. They continue to cost me valuable time and money and for some reason can’t seem to figure out ANYTHING! They sure were able to take my money very easily, funny how it’s seemingly impossible to get it back .. This app and wallet seem “scammy”.

I left and didn’t think I was coming back. I decided to give them another try about 6-7 months ago and started purchasing on the platform again weekly. Now that it’s time to withdraw some funds and they claim the payment method is invalid/not supported, whatever. Just saw someone else that’s with the same bank withdraw funds to their debit card with no issue. To add your bank account it will take 3-5 business days unless you use a 3rd party which makes no sense. Coinbase clearly does not care because other people have complained about this and I’ve seen no reasonable explanation for why it’s not working. I just transferred all my coins off the platform to uphold and withdrew within 2 minutes. I don’t recommend this platform to anyone it’s clear they don’t care about their customers or resolving on going issues. I won’t be back."

They will investigate them and handle this matter for me. I have also locked my Coinbase account..  anyone who is having trouble withdrawing their money. I suggest you contact the fraud department of your bank and let them know what is going on and they will investigate and I’m sure they’ll get your money for you for. I did get my money back and I’m appreciative of that but now they’re wanting me to return $2500 which is my $2500 and this $2500.

coinbase,ios,Дирки,1,2024-06-07 00:19:11,"During the period of high demand for cryptocurrency, I topped up my balance with a debit card, after which I bought Bitcoin. They debited the money from my bank account. A few days later, I find out that they sold my Bitcoin to cover the payment because payment was canceled (they had “”a server error”” and many payments were canceled, and they refunded the money to the card). Without any prior notification! I found out about it only after the fact. The support team didn’t even think about apologizing or compensating for the losses. At first, I thought I was hacked! The Bitcoin was sold automatically, I paid REALLY BIG commissions for buying and selling, and I had to buy bitcoin again at price 3000$ higher than the original price. 

This is common practice on crypto exchanges, but I thought Coinbase was a reputable organization and wouldn’t engage in such deceitful fraud. I do not recommend keeping any funds with them or using them in general; they have huge commissions. A waste of time and money."
coinbase,ios,Dr. Lysol,1,2022-06-15 00:12:55,"DO NOT USE this app, they wont let you withdraw your crypto or your money freely.
My DL just expired days before I tried to withdraw my crypto, when I tried they came with this “to withdraw you have to validate your ID” process which is stupid when you have 2factor authentication activated. Anyways, I tried to get a new one but DMV is pretty slow, DMV gave me a temporary paper to drive instead so I couldn't get a renewed DL to show them. Coinbase do not accept passports (which is absurd) and they don't give you alternatives to the DL, they don't want to help you at all. 
The other day I finally got my new DL so I validated my ID, even then they were causing problems with the pictures I sent, so another day lost. Then, yesterday, when I tried to withdraw they block my account for 24h saying “we block any account if you log in from a new device”, I was logging in from the same computer I use to log in since I created the account!! I will not trust Coinbase with my money or my crypto again."

But when I’m in the app and click the pop up screen and the blue button it just takes me to the settings . No camera option to take the picture to verify. Now on the computer in the Coinbase page it says to go into the document verification page and it shows lit up like it will take you and that leads to a 404 error page. So I’m confused I can’t even load more money to get more stock and it’s basicly a infinity loop of never going to work cause the settings in the phone don’t even have what’s shown."

They’ve played a huge role in bringing new people and money into the crypto space, and they also help smaller projects gain visibility. However, my main issue with Coinbase is their overly compliant stance with U.S. regulators. While compliance is necessary, it would be great to see them push back a little instead of rolling over every time new regulations come up. A more balanced approach—one that advocates for innovation and decentralization—would make Coinbase an even stronger player in the industry.

Overall, it’s a solid platform, but I wish Brian Armstrong would take a firmer stance on protecting the crypto ecosystem."

They told me not to come to Coinbase but did I listen? No. So I opened an account. Added my bank account and purchased a hefty amount of crypto. I purchased 3 different types. Long story short a few days later. I went to purchase more and they kept failing my transactions saying that my bank said I had insufficient funds. I had plentyyyyyyyy Of money in my account. However I called my bank and they there is no issues or hold ups. Mind you this took a couple of Hours to get straight. Well the stock I was wanting to invest to make profits in ended up sky rocketing and I couldn’t get any transactions because their system would not allow me to spend money. Well now fast forward 6+ days and they finally get back to me with no customer service that actually would take care of me. Do not go here. Don’t spend money here. Go to any other place for your fiat currency switch. They do not care about their clients at Coinbase.
coinbase,ios,I hunks,1,2017-12-29 15:39:34,"I occasionally buy bitcoin from time to time and this is the first time I’ve used coinbase as a bitcoin wallet. Since I don’t have a credit or debit card being at a young age, I decide to use a separate exchange, Paxful , which lets me buy bitcoins with gift cards. I transferred my bitcoins to coinbase thinking it was a good wallet, but I was complete wrong. What ended up happening was the transfer from paxful to coinbase took about an hour longer than the stated time to transfer only about 17 dollars when in reality it should only take about 2 minutes. When my coinbase wallet was funded, I tried to send them out for a transaction and was greeted with the lovely message saying that I “did not have enough funds to complete to transaction” when I only tried to send 5 dollars from my account, therefore locking me from my bitcoins. Coinbase in a nutshell is a company composed of thieves. When you buy from them or use them as a wallet, they do every scummy thing in the book to take your money. Coinbase is a terrible bitcoin exchange to buy and store your bitcoins with."
coinbase,ios,Turbo2252,1,2021-12-18 02:58:02,"There hasn’t been one update lately that actually helps your clients. For example you removed the charts for almost every screen to make your users have a harder time figuring out how a crypto is doing that day. You still refuse to hire customer service. Which is probably one of the most garbage ways of running a company that involves peoples money. The amount of people that have problems with what you do as a company would make you think you would try to change things to become a better company for your users. But that’s not the case. So if you’re not doing these updates to help your users, who are you doing them for? This app has become a shell of itself in just that last several months.

Just noticed another update as soon as I finished typing this. Guess what? The update fixed nothing. All Coinbase does is remove features that they feel like can’t help you actually make some money. Basically their crooks. Real apparent at this point."

From there, I was denied usage because of the ID verification process. I provided my valid NJ drivers license multiple times, but was rejected each time. When contacting Coinbase support, they told me to repeat the process and take a selfie. After this attempt, I was told that my ID name (Jonathan K Van Dongen) does not match my Legal Name (Jonathan Van Dongen), which is obviously absurd. They have repeatedly sent me the same message to use the 3-picture verification without any additional support and will not let me talk to a Coinbase support specialist “for security reasons”. So I still cannot use this account because Coinbase is not sophisticated enough to recognize my middle initial in my driver’s license.

Save your time. Use Binance. What a horrible experience."

My gripe is the app seems to miss providing a few modules that I’d consider must have or desirable info I would want access to at least without having to search for it. Specifically, my cost basis, then most recently pulled off or relocated are my recurring purchases. The ‘trade’ option on the bottom menu has been replaced with ‘prices’ which provides overlapping and less than useful info I can get on other tabs (how is this different than a watchlist?) At this point I have no idea without logging into the browser app how to find my recurring buys. Final change I’d ask for is to kill off the feature that automatically adds my holdings or purchases to my watchlist. I use watchlists to follow assets I don’t yet own so having to unstar each one I buy into is less than ideal."

Go on google and search up coinbase reward or coinbase spin the wheel. You will find nothing online about a spin the wheel only see how thousands of customers never got it and when they ask for help the representatives are the dumbest people around. They ask you the same thing over and over with no real help or answers. Worst ever. I then got 3$ from the representative and the next email i get back from them is them saying seems like you got 3$ that i was set with the promo when the representative gave me that for the problems i was having not the promo THEYYYY offered.

I will be removing my money and never using this ridiculous app again. I recommend all other users do the same and continue writing 1 star reviews until they “fix” their problems.

to others out there, but I have had issues come up in my account twice (simple problems) and both times there hasent been any semblance of support. Both times my account was locked, unable to buy or sell crypto I owned and no matter how hard I tried and deep I dug into their “help center” I couldn’t get an actual person to respond or help.
Even their live chat are just programmed responses that will ultimately lead to you waiting day for support to respond to you email request for hep. If you like talking to automated responses this is the platform for you, otherwise stay away and go with a better managed platform that invested in their customers instead of pushing you off and hoping that you’ll stay."

To start earning sooner, you can verify your photo and identity on Coinbase”. SEVEN emails from me back and forth to Coinbase Support (including sending them a copy of their own aforementioned email that I was verified several times) has only resulted in form emails being returned, responses not relevant to the issue or no response at all.

The manager incorrectly referred to me as a woman after I disclosed my sexual orientation, which I perceived as discriminatory. Throughout the process, I have been assured that my case would be escalated and that I would receive a follow-up within three days. Unfortunately, this has not occurred, despite being told this on multiple occasions. In my most recent chat, I was advised to contact the police. I feel that Coinbase has failed to provide adequate support, mistreated me, and misgendered me. It appears that they are unwilling to take responsibility for the security of their customers' accounts. Consequently, I would advise against using their services, as your funds may not be safe, and you may not receive proper assistance or communication."

Go cross the border so I can log in? Just because one doesn’t have a valid CA id or valid DL, you just don’t let me log in?? What if DMV doesn’t let me have my DL and ID? So you just hold my money forever??

They will lie and say if you buy x amount of funds that it will be instantly sendable. So then I buy it and it tells me it isn’t sendable and they I have to way 7 days for it to be sendable. I can’t cancel the order either. They essentially tell you something so you can spend money, they lie, and keep those funds locked into their system for 7 days. They will not help with support even with the higher ups. It’s just lies upon lies upon lies. I wouldn’t be surprised if what they are doing is illegal and they get shut down.

I think that adding these features would greatly increase trading productivity and allow one to see what yields and returns are happening. And maximize profit on both ends….

Their fees are a little high, sure, but that’s the price you pay knowing that your credit card number / bank account number is safe and in good hands. Easy app, awesome for beginners. As soon as you’re ready to play with the high-rollers, just switch over to their professional-trader sister site GDAX (which you can log into with your Coinbase account). If you pair Coinbase with another excellent exchange app, Binance, you can easily fund your crypto accounts with USD and have access to a massive variety of altcoins.

coinbase,ios,planeKrazy,1,2021-02-09 07:56:38,"I had a Bank of America checking account linked to CoinBase. For several years in fact. Out of the blue my checking account has been de-linked (even though I could still instantaneously buy and sell cryptos). To relink it CoinBase uses a company called “Plaid”. You have to select your bank, type in your user name and password (for the bank) and then it tells you your bank account is incompatible with CoinBase because your bank uses two-way sign-in verification?!? Something I’ve been doing for some 5 years now and which hasn’t ever been a problem - until CoinBase started using Plaid that is.
One would think CoinBase would promote account online safety. Instead they want me to opt-out if two-way verification option at Bank of America in order for my account to be re-linked to CoinBase. Unbelievable .. 
Did I mention you’ll wait weeks (not days) for a reply from CB “customer support? ..oh the “customer Support” person’s name is .. “customer support”. They won’t ever use an actual name?! ..makes you feel truly well-taken care of.."
coinbase,ios,SandyLPH,5,2024-03-01 17:56:39,"As I’m up in years, it’s very difficult for me to understand how Coinbase actually works even though I have been buying & selling through your website for two years. I. E.:  In the beginning I was able to sell some of my purchases and the money went directly back into my bank account. Now it goes to a “crypto card” without asking me where I want “my sell” funds to go. I have no clue how to use that card- no number to call for help. I did get a live chat person once who said a tech would call me- but I rejected the call as no indication it was about Coinbase as it was for the Netherlands when I live in the USA!  Very deceiving so I am still perplexed at how to cash out crypto to go back into my linked bank account!!!! HELP!!"
coinbase,ios,SurVibin_,1,2024-03-05 08:38:00,"There was a major server issue that stopped me from selling my crypto which directly led to me losing over 15% of my portfolio and possibly almost 60% of my portfolio’s worth of possible gains. I reached out to them, they said they couldn’t do anything about it because of a term the have within the terms of service that CONVENIENTLY addresses this exact issue. You might be thinking, “I feel like the loss of funds due to ANY disruption of the system isn’t their fault” but I disagree for three reasons: 

1. This completely allows them do mess with their own servers in order to make the system “not work properly” (or make it seem that way) without facing any legal consequences.

2. The MOST LIKELY did number one because Shiba was at a 3 or 4 year high and 2nd largest crypto by daily volume so it was bound to gain highly (which it did, a crazy 90%+ gain in 24 hours).

3. This is unlikely to be noticed unless something like what I described in number 2 happens, so they can scam everyone on the app if something really did happen. 

Also a few other things to note: 

1. Their customer service is not great, even when you pay for Coinbase One it’s still useless and you can even hear them talking in the background while they say “call volumes are higher than usual”.

2. They are NOT insured by FDIC or any insurance related companies like that. If they get hacked or robbed, YOU get hacked and robbed."

I sent a small amount of Crypto to invest in an NFT (that many of my friends also invested in) and Coinbase said the Wallet was Blacklisted?? So my friends are collecting weekly revenue streams because they used Meta mask and their investment funds went through. Coinbase froze my ability to transact for 60 days. That is an unacceptable amount of time. Etrade is so easy to get on the phone, Coinbase it seems to be impossible! All you get is a chat online with someone or often an Ai chat bot that just repeats itself, which is no help at all???

coinbase,ios,Review_is_life,1,2022-12-06 04:36:35,"Whoever decided to merge Coinbase Pro with Coinbase didn’t do tiny bit of market research. 
Where is VOC when it comes to major updates like these? Or you just let your product managers run the show to create ‘work’ so they appear busy with scrum calls?

Coinbase Pro was so good when it came to looking at charts or placing orders. 

However, this app is a trash, here is why:

1. I literally had to search where and how to add funds. Was the UX designer intern and not FTE ? Did you guys do any usability studies? Give this app to 100 random people and see how many can figure out how to add funds in first minute.

2. The charts are messed up no matter you use candle or lines. Once you pinch to adjust x axis or y axis, it gets messed up and makes it impossible to read. 

3. The order entry mechanism has been made unnecessarily complex. You have to use the back arrow to change the default price. 

4. There is a lot of self promotion going on on the ‘asset’ tab. I want to see my assets, period. Don’t waste the real estate there with some fluff stuff.

Overall a BIG disappointment! 
This is a serious business involving money. Why would you mess something that is already working, aka Coinbase Pro just so that your product team has something to work (mess up) on ? 

Please escalate this to your C suite leadership and have them investigate whose idea it was to eff up working product. 
Shame on the team who messed this up big time."

I was on level 3 which means you can buy, sell and use to purchase anything as long as you have the money in your account. I figured after day one, Coinbase no longer suited my needs so I attempted to close the account only to be greeted by a note stating,  “I have to wait 15 days, before I could withdraw my funds and close the account. Nowhere that was stated. I reached out to Coinbase support, pleading to close the account. They replied they couldn’t until 15 days. I called my bank to file a claim after emailing Coinbase numerous times to come to a solution. My bank resolved it on my end in a couple days. The following Coinbase responds with deactivating my account and threatening to sell my funds in 2 days. Wow! I don’t owe them anything so why are they selling my funds or keeping to repay a debt?  I’ve had the account a week. Worst customer service ever. Their definitely other services out there. Don’t listen to these fake reviews"

Also, I tried one other thing to confirm it was not a network issue but Coinbase preventing their clients from converting back to USD, if I tried to convert my kryll to any other crypto Coinbase trades it let me do it instantly. If more of you are experiencing the same thing I think we should be looking to take legal action against Coinbase.  The link you want me to use I’ve used it and all I got was another basic link and a troubleshoot with no resolution to the problem get a real person on a phone and try to resolve this issue this is not a few bucks product that’s not working we are talking about peoples investments in thousands and all you guys have is a messaging service to resolve these type of issue’s?"
coinbase,ios,Jim Frenowsky,4,2021-12-08 16:01:22,"Overall great app in basically every way you could ask for. My only complaint is I have whiplash from all of the UI updates. Today it changed for, I believe, the fourth time in 2021. And all these updates ever change is that they remove the little chart preview on the asset tile that you can see before you click to open it. And then within a few weeks it’s back again. Just decide—I don’t care what you do, just decide lol. It’s extremely disorienting to have UI change this often, and it’s unprecedented for an application that has this high a profile.

Also, this UI update shortened the watchlist to 4 and put a “view more” button there instead of allowing you to scroll through your watchlist. In what way could that be viewed as an improvement?"

Wire transfer take 2-3 days. Instant buy with Coinbase now hold your coin for about 5 days. To make the matter worse.  I transferred some BTC from other account to then deposit into GDAX to convert to ETHER but they clump that deposit into

Verified my savings (which the wife didn’t like) so then I verified my checking and deleted my savings.  bought $300 worth of crypto with my checking and it was all good. So Thursday morning I bought another $40 worth and then Thursday night I get an e mail saying there was something wrong with my bank account. Looked at my account and they took the money out already which was good but weird. So I tried to verify my account again and it won’t let me. Says there’s a connection problem and I try to verify it again and it says I have maxed out my attempts to verify and to try again in 7 days. I wanted to put another $200 in today but I can’t because I can’t add an account. Idk if it’s a glitch or what is going on. So i sent them a e mail since that’s the only way you can get ahold of them. Waiting for a response and all I wanted to do was add more money. 😡
coinbase,ios,Eric21221,1,2018-01-28 08:17:03,"Easy to use but they charge excessive fees. Also defeats the purpose of Bitcoin because they are basically the “bank”. Many other options out there. If you send Bitcoin to an address that they don’t like or feel you should transact with, they close your account, hold your funds and then after a while you can send them to another Bitcoin wallet.

Why are they tracking and analyzing where you send your Bitcoin? I know they have to do verification and prevent fraud/illegal activity since you can fund with a bank account or credit card. But send BTC to an address they flag as violating their TOS and you’re out. Even if you send BTC to a friend or someone else who has sent BTC to one of their flagged addresses and you’re out. Their not only tracking who you send/receive BTC to but also who your sender/receiver has transacted with. If you do use them to buy BTC, transfer it out of there as soon as you can. You don’t own the private key to the wallet, it’s stored on their servers and they log and track every move you make."

Had to go through the maze to get to chat, get there and if you ask any questions deviating from FAQ it just ends the chat and asks how it was. Long story short, bank is verified, card is verified and they had no problem taking my money, but when it came for them to pay me, literally only popped up invalid and no other options than to abandon my money.

Easy set-up, easy execution, easy, easy, easy. 
For a long while, I had hesitated (for a myriad of reasons) to buy into crypto. 
After doing more digging, research and reading (personally recommend “Bitcoin Billionaires” for a fun Bitcoin / crypto broad strokes overview/explanation), I joined the mass movement…like a skeptical and inexperienced swimmer testing the ocean w her toe. 
Since I was not planning on becoming a crypto genius (i.e., willing to spend only minimal time/effort), I reviewed options and ultimately downloaded Coinbase. Friends of mine registered for other platforms around the same time. Side by side comparison and returns: for managing my modest approach to crypto, Coinbase exceeds my needs. 
Some of my friends with other platforms have expressed extreme frustration with lagging transition times and limitations of their chosen platforms. . . But, they may be attempting more complex transactions than me? Perhaps they’d have the same issues w Coinbase? …
So far, I love how simple this app makes crypto transactions. Couple clicks and done, and my relative return seems on par w others who got in at the same time, so I take that to mean, less effort and same results = a positive review."
coinbase,ios,Gmpact,1,2025-02-12 04:57:05,"I have been a loyal Coinbase customer for years, consistently purchasing and managing cryptocurrency through their platform without issue. However, recently, I found myself suddenly blocked from buying and sending crypto—without any clear explanation or justification. Despite reaching out for clarification, I have received vague, unhelpful responses that do not address the core issue. This lack of transparency and arbitrary restriction on my funds feels like outright fraud. At this point, I feel like I am being robbed, with no recourse or clear path to resolve the situation. A financial platform handling digital assets must be trustworthy, reliable, and communicative. Unfortunately, Coinbase has failed in all three areas. I strongly caution anyone considering using this platform—your funds are at risk of being frozen without reason, and customer support offers little to no assistance. Until Coinbase takes accountability and provides clear, fair resolutions to such issues, I cannot recommend them to anyone!"

It was a pleasure to use coinbase back then. Now I don't trust them to hold $1 of my funds. They are incredibly incompetent. You cannot even talk to a real support agent even when you have 6 figures in an account with them. They will not let you speak to a real person if you have an issue (and YOU WILL EVENTUALLY HAVE AN ISSUE). They have gone so far down hill it really saddens me to see. The app crashes frequently when crypto is booming so you can't sell or buy. The incompetence it takes to have that happen is astounding (from a systems engineer prospective). This leads me to not trust them with holding digital assets. I am genuinely worried a mistake could be made at the tech level to lose massive amounts of user funds. Therefore I stay away. Just a warning from a long time now ex-customer. Look for an exchange that will have at least a hair of respect for you.

Support just opens a ticket, and quietly forgets and ignores the request. I've had multiple transactions that say they paid out the reward but never actually did, and a couple that are months old that took the money for the transaction but the reward state is stuck in pending. It's not exactly the app's fault, and overall CB is a good fiat on off ramp for US citizens, but support is basically non existent. The interface of the app is slightly annoying. Should be able to customize the layout to what we use the most, and whenever I need to input 2 factor auth it opens a web view, auto focuses the input, and immediately the input is no longer active so I have to touch the input again.

Coinbase support is HORRIBLE. I have tried reaching out to CEO, tried escalating as much as I can but Coinbase is taking no responsibility. As a publicly traded company and a company which I pay a service fee for each transaction, I cannot believe their response. If you lost your savings wouldn’t you expect a company try to find the source and provide some type of response / call from management taking responsibility for their actions? No such response here.

It is honestly great, simple easy to use. One thing I wish they would add is something like what robinhood has where in the portfolio you can choose either to display the last price, percent change, total returns. That would be helpful instead of having to manually click each crypto and see how much I originally spent on it vs what it is at now. Also..... and I can not stress this enough, can we please get DARK MODE. Robinhood has one and so do many other apps. My eyes can’t take it. So yea overall, great app.

They lack telling you that it takes 48+ hours to withdraw your coins back into your exchange wallet to sell/convert. Completely ruins your advantage in the market because the market could drop in 48+ hours. I put the plus because it was much longer and after a certain point they just stopped updating me. Updates are sparse, leave you hanging and don’t count down. I had 1.25 ETH ($830 USD) and couldn’t do a thing with it in the meantime, stressing the whole time.

For example if you send bitcoin cash from coinbase to yobit.  There is a very big problem and coinbase does not care to help.  Thats wrong, and very bad because money is being stolen/lost/misplaced.  Many have researched into this and there are ways to et those funds back.  But untill you guys care to help here at coinbase nothing can be done unless one started a class action lawsuit and put a lean on all your assets and funds!  Hope these things get worked out.

Update:  Got a response from customer service.  “Follow these steps...”  The very first step was to follow a link to their site to complete some form.  I have no idea what that was supposed to be because the link doesn’t work, sending me instead to the page that just tells me my account has been closed.  Fortunately, on that page I was able to transfer my money back out of the account to my bank, so I’m getting out and never looking back.

I also find it annoying that I can’t just pick a price from the listed sell prices to sell at that price. Since some prices have many many digits in them, it’s very hard to specify my price. I would like to be able to pick from the list of prices that others are selling for and place an order to sell at that price. It’s the same case for buying as well"

They have a dozen reasons for why you will not be able to cash out your balance, and will offer you absolutely no helpful kind of support whatsoever unless your account is compromised, from my understanding anyways, who knows if they’d even help you then. Several features on both the app and desktop versions don’t work. Such as addding a debit card, unless it’s just me.

Either way. I’m trying to cash out. And you can’t from wallet. You have to send funds back to Coinbase and pay a fee. Then convert fiat currency and pay a fee.

coinbase,ios,Grayishnevada,1,2024-12-14 10:38:16,"This app scammed me. I installed it for the first time, set up my account, banking, and verified my information. I then went to buy crypto and it allowed me to do so but then after I purchased it locked me from buying/selling until I verified my information, which I already did, and told me I had a payment due. When I tried to reverify my information and pay the payment due, which was nothing according even to the app, the app repeatedly malfunctioned and did not allow me make any further actions. So after two weeks of being unable to confirm my information or make a payment I am now locked out of my account and the money I put in is gone/locked (I’m not even sure it’s just gone from my account) and the best part is I have to pay the difference (since the crypto I purchased has since gone down) to reopen my account. But when I try to do that, nothing happens. This app is not the greatest and I do not recommend it. 0 stars."

There’s no need for them to make the spread fee so high on top of another ridiculous “Coinbase” that Robinhood doesn’t even do. I asked from a refund and they said they couldn’t. People trying to make a little extra money on the side can’t because they eat all your gains! You just loose so much money with greedy companies like this, tried the free trial to waive the fees and instead of making money from the waived fees I lost $118!

They are innovative, educational, and I love the instant withdrawal back to your verified bank accounts.  They have a debit card feature which is excellent.  However, they had direct deposits of your paychecks, enabling customers to totally bypass the banks, but as of November 25, 2024, they are ending their direct deposit feature.  Not sure why, but I hope it’s to bring back something better that they’re working on.  I imagine it might have something to do with a new stablecoin integration or development (i.e. RLUSD), but I’ll be looking forward to seeing the direct deposit feature return in some format.

LOCKED OUT MY ACCOUNT for the 9th time verified each time and changing passwords. When it’s time to dollar cost average aka (buy the dip) they restrict buying features. My buy function has been locked for 2 months now. I can even a Coinbase one member. What’s the point of paying for a membership, which they raised the price again. If you can’t even buy crypto, why can’t I get a membership refund!!! I’ve used coin base for multiple years and this isn’t the first time this happened.

Anyways where I’m most upset is I tried sending some crypto and my transaction was pending.  A day or so later it changed to cancelled.  I got on with a chat asked why.  Now everything on my account was blocked.  I can’t buy crypto sell, trade, nothing everything was locked.  Everything that was in motion said cancelled.

So I went on MetaMask finished my transaction, got my money back from this scam thing and I delete and block them I came out breaking even…. Until three days later that cancelled transaction somehow magically went through.  What on earth?   

I got an apology.  But I’m out $3,000.  That really hurts.  In round 1 of this scam I just got totally blocked and could t finished and they disappeared.  They came back I had figured them out and wanted to get my money back and the. Mama and papa Coinbase decided to help protect me.  Both times they try to help me caused me lost funds.  

I’ll never be doing the scam again, at first it seemed legit, then it wasn’t and to get out costs extra.  

Anyways I am told I have an atypical case.

Atypical cases with Coinbase means they hold no responsibility.  They are not going to take care of their mistakes.  

Granted I shouldn’t have gotten involved in the first place, however, I got myself out of the situation, Coinbase pushed me back into a loss"
coinbase,ios,iRaiderade,1,2022-08-18 13:49:46,Coinbase continues to put out more products and asks its users to download those apps and use the services. The latest example is Coinbase One in which they asked me to sign up for a beta version. I apparently signed up for it without knowing they would charge $30 a month for it if I didn’t cancel. I was charged for two months of the service not knowing this and had not used it once. It took me hours and hours to figure why I was being charged. When I finally figured it out I was then told they wouldn’t refund me because of their “terms of service”. If you are not going to refund users for these type of things and make them run in circles to get help with the issue it is irresponsible to make it so easy to opt in to the service. I cannot believe the user interface is as good as it is but the customer service is so terrible.  It really is unfortunate but this experience will likely be the reason I go elsewhere for crypto.
coinbase,ios,Sean286,1,2021-12-06 11:03:50,"Everything was going well and working almost flawlessly for about 3 months. Until tonight.
I decided to check my “learn and earn” assets in my coinbase wallet. For those who don’t know, this “learn and earn” feature allows users to gain dollar value rewards on different crypto coins offered through the app. In my experience, some will earn you as low as $3 and as high as $10.
However, when I check my assets, I can only see the price per coin for the transactions that i’ve paid for out of my pocket?? Any other coin that I haven’t paid for personally(including the coins and rewards gifted to me by coinbase) isn’t able to give me any information as to what price the coin was when I received it from these reward programs? How am I supposed to use that information at all going forward? Oh, that’s right, I can’t. Let alone, in an app that is supposed to be unequivocally providing me with the proper information i need to invest? Thanks for wasting my time!"

Coinbase charges a large fee whenever you sell and buy assets to the point that I couldn’t even sell .20 worth of my XRP because it wouldn’t be enough for them to charge another stupid “fee” when I sell. I only put a little money in there just so I can test the app out before putting in more money. They purposely want you to spend more money into their app and charge more fees. To send XRP crypto to another wallet, the minimum amount has to be at least 22. This is dumb. It should’ve allowed me to transfer all my XRP regardless of how low it is. I’m glad I never put much money into this app. Switching to Binance where the fees are much more reasonable."

Quick Facts:
A. Been a member since 2017
B. Bought coins and were left in my cb account since then.
C. Account was verified.

Present:
A. Bought btc on 09 Mar and received initial hold for 20 days. Policy is only 3-5 business days or upto 10 calendar days. Like my previous purchase written above.

B. Called support for review of my account and increase my dc/cc purchase limits. Received email of request, decision/reply within 4-6 business days. It was passed 4 days with no response. 

C. Called support again for the same reason. Support reassured that my btc purchase is there because they could see the transaction. and again, a ticket was sent with the same caption 4-6 days turn around time.  Nope no response again regarding the case, nor from any specialist. 

D. Checked my CB app some days later and to my whopping surprise, my hold days increased from the initial 20 days (it was counting down btw) to 99 day hold. No joke. So i called support again, and heard the same old excuses, “we’ll look into it”, “dont worry sir, our specialist will review this matter”.   What a big wonkers CB app process has become. 

Nope there has not been any responses from any CB specialists nor could further explain as to why the hold days were increased drastically. My bank has cleared the charges for over a week now. The hold days are literally active and its at T-minus 95 days till funds released."
coinbase,ios,HomeGrownJones,1,2018-04-24 16:08:08,"Coinbase used to be a great service. It was fast, reliable and easy to use. Lately though I've had a lot of trouble with them since they've been updating their company to comply with federal regulations, which I don't necessarily mind. But I'm having trouble with a bug that's affected a lot of other people according to Reddit. I used to have a max exchange limit of $400 a purchase for over two years, but since I added a new debit card it dropped my limit to $100 A WEEK! That's insane and seriously inhibits my ability to invest. I called customer service and they told me there's nothing they can do for me or anyone else with this problem. Basically Coinbase doesn't wanna invest the resources that a billion dollar company like them could afford. So finally I tried a last ditch effort. I verified my ID and filled out their invasive personal information form. I was told doing so would raise my limit but it didn't change anything. I really hope they lose enough business to actually hurt them."

They had no problem taking it out right away though out of my bank account, still hasn't cleared for use though 2 weeks later. The first time I bought a light coin it took a week for them to tell me that they just didn't process it and I was SOL. Meanwhile, during all this waiting, Im missing out on a ton of opportunities to buy at a low price.

coinbase,ios,Armagumo,1,2023-05-27 18:33:22,"The app has gotten worse since my previous review regarding ACH/Instant Transfer. 

DO NOT USE APPLE PAY: There’s a chance they will decline the transaction and then drop your all of your debit card limits to $0.00. This app somehow manages to get worse with each update.

The instant transfer option isn’t instant. So if it doesn’t go through — say if you don’t have enough money to cover the withdrawal — Coinbase will prevent you from conducting transactions and inform you that you owe them for the purchase of the cryptocurrency. 

The kicker is that you can’t pay them back with a debit card; it has to be through a bank and connected through Plaid which supports mostly traditional institutions such as Bank of America, Chase, etc. 

I don’t have and do not want traditional banking. So I’m basically punished for it by the website and app. 

 Ironically, the bank account I originally used—which wasn’t a traditional bank and had to be connected for the transaction—was still connected. 

Even with the money to cover the original transaction — they can’t process it. So I’m up the creek without a paddle. They refuse to allow anything other than a bank account, wire transfer, Coinbase gift card or direct deposit. The payment methods can all be added but I don’t think you can use anything with the exception of a bank account. It’s very frustrating."

The next time I deposited some more money they put a 60 day hold on it I have no access to the money whatsoever, they are just making money off of my money. There is nobody there you can talk to. That can actually do something. I do not recommend Coinbase any longer. It is not safe to put your money in there. As soon as I have access to my money. I’m pulling it out. Update,,,, so I guess a human noticed I made the comment and said he sincerely apologized and insured that they would look into the account and then asked if I would change my review. Sorry Coinbase not until I get my money back. Customer service just apologizes and says there is nothing they can do. The say it is for my safety. That is garbage!!!

They charge ridiculous fees which they excuse by saying a pro account can qualify for lower fees (that are still stupidly high compared to another app I use). Their customer service makes excuses about why something is not the company’s fault, if they even respond at all. I have not had a satisfactory response in how to close an account when there is less than the required minimum to transfer out of the app, since I first tried to close my account. I was told I have to deposit enough crypto in order to meet the minimum. However I am unwilling to pay their ridiculous fee to do so. I’ll just keep it open as a novelty and learning aid when I explain to others why in my opinion Coinbase is worse than even the scammy crypto companies.

As well, there is a statement on the Help page that states a phone number is provided in the Help Desk email I was to receive, yet nary a one was provided. The email response was dismissive, and in no way me helped me rectify the issue. Rather the CS rep closed with, we appreciate your understanding in this matter.

Well let me tell you, the help chat is absolutely useless. The agents will get disconnected for no reason at all. New agents join and start off by saying “Let me read the chat so I can get an understanding before we start”. Then, ask the same prompted questions the previous agent before them had asked. Joshua Elmer Fredrick asked me the same questions 3 times and then refused to forward me to a supervisor. I’ve reached out to their chat, email, instagram DM, and no one can help me. It’s the same prompted generated answers. I’m switching to RobinHood, they have cheaper fees anyways."
coinbase,ios,Fuzaldrin,1,2021-04-05 15:19:49,"Firstly I’d like to start by saying that I started off really enjoying coinbase. Everything was going great. I really liked this app and it’s features. However if I could I’d give this app no stars. The reason I am writing this review is because I have only had my account for less than 8 weeks and have been locked out of it for 6. I immediately contacted coinbase support and was told my issue would be resolved in something like 4-7 business days. It has been over a month. Since then I haven’t even been able to log in let alone trade. When a company has your money they shouldn’t keep you from accessing it like this. This is absolutely unacceptable and unless my issue gets resolved this negative review stands.

Update: Dec. 16, 2020

Still no access to my account. My initial review was posted some time in October after a month of not having access to my account. Don’t use this app unless you want you money taken from you.

Update: Mar. 28, 2021 

After months of being ghosted, I was finally reached out to for my account to reactivated. This whole ordeal was very annoying however, upon signing into my account, I did see that my investments had appreciated in value substantially. Maybe it was a good thing I didn’t have access to my account, but it is still something I hope to never have to deal with again.

Back when you can actually talk to a human I tried getting the issue resolved but they could not get it through there heads that it’s a coin base issue.  I requested to talk to a manager and he rudely hung up on me I called him out on it and your support team did nothing to resolve the horrible customer service.  The manager on duty was named Victor and Loui both of those guys shouldn’t be called managers at all.

Once I tried to reverse it, I couldn’t get a hold of anyone at their support team to reverse this. I decided to call my bank to block the transaction and now that they did, coinbase is threatening to liquidate my remaining assets into cash unless paid. This is awesome too because since my bank account blocked the transaction, they removed it from my account. So I write this review while currently being on hold for +30 minutes to finally put a voice to this company and app. Had they made it clear I was depositing more funds into my account vs what a normal person would assume a deposit for their bank account to be (money back in) then I could have avoided this whole process.

When asked to provide transaction history proving that the balance was zero, I got a response saying there was no transaction history for the account. After providing ample evidence that there is transaction history attached to the account and multiple bank transactions with Coinbase, I keep getting what looks like an AI response that is in no way helpful or resolving any of my concerns.

                          ⭐️  🌟  ⭐️  🌟  ⭐️

Good morning, and in. Are I don’t see ya; Good afternoon, good evening, and goodnight!

Wow, where do I start!? 

I’ve been using this app ‘from day one son!”. Yes, day ☝️. I absolutely love it, and recommend all users, especially ‘newbs’,  (new people to crypto) to use this route when purchasing cryptocurrency! 

It’s super simple and easy to use. This app is without a doubt the most intuitive, no B/S, straight to the point way to get started with crypto. 

I am very well versed when it comes to tech and the UX (User Experience), as I develop massive interfaces for entire buildings, commercial, residential, and business, home automation systems. I’ve made user interfaces for every type of system you can think of. What I’m saying is, the UX plays a major part of an apps ‘make it or break it’ Philosophy. If an app is to difficult to navigate, it can break a company. Well this app definitely meets, and exceeds, this. 

Anyone looking to get into crypto, if you don’t start here, you will never make it. 

Get this app people! It will change your life forever!"
coinbase,ios,rickrolled-1,1,2021-12-19 15:55:42,"Does company think 5% apy is life changing?
I don’t think so because most people are scared to  get loans, And at the Max apy % is 5% and only on Cosmo
And no other crypto is their to invest in which could make life better what most users desire is at least 15% apy and that amount can actually help especially when the economy is in negative inflation 
I hope i made some sense that the users desire more because your company does have fees right? No one works for free right?  so do more to provide a broad spectrum to choose from to earn more apy% rather than surviving on 5% apy its just not enough hopefully in the b Beginning of 2022 or before summer otherwise ill gladly choose another platform, i only came to Coinbase because of the company out reach to crypto community which is fading away please offer more apy% more than 5%
To keep on innovating and keep your company stable and in existence to keep on serving for a better tomorrow, thanks and please take action soon !"

Coinbase even tho the account was shut down allowed the money to be traded for 5 days in which it lost lost money. So when they went to figure the fraud out over a week later, they took my real investment to pay the return on the negative fraud investment, essentially stealing my money as the admit in emails they knew it was fraud and if you read their disclaimers on fraud they are to cover it. I honestly question if they do this to many and then just take your money? It’s almost impossible to reach anyone here and takes a week for them to reply to emails.

I invested in another app that end up going on bankruptcy and lost some money, and that’s why I stayed with Coinbase. I would like to mention that the “learning and earning” program is awesome! It allows you to learn how things work in this “crypto world” and you make some money at the same time. It’s amazing!

coinbase,ios,garbage!?!$$,1,2020-12-22 14:24:16,"Terrible apps. Extremely difficult to sign up. Coinbase and Coinbase pro apps asked for my ID, which I “successfully” submitted. After “successful” submission, the apps kept telling me that ID verification was necessary, but provided no further guidance nor a link for whatever was necessary, even after having accepted my submission. I finally used the computer based platform, which again asked for my ID, but also a “selfie”. After several attempts, I was finally successful on the computer platform. Please note that the mobile platforms themselves inexplicably provided no guidance in this process (a simple message such as “using the computer based platform is necessary for this step” would have sufficed). 

Now that I’m certified with a linked bank account, Coinbase works however inexplicably buys are disabled on Coinbase pro. Absolutely no guidance is provided as to why. Can somebody please explain how Coinbase allows me to buy but pro does not? These are linked services!

Please note that customer service is essentially not available. They do not respond to emails, which is their only available means of “customer support.” Apparently phone support is only available if you feel your account has been compromised.

This is deplorable. How am I supposed to feel comfortable investing serious money on this platform when I can’t even talk to a person nor can the platform guide me throw any issues that may arise?"

CC/Debit card however is instant, with a 20$ fee for your troubles. Once you have money in your wallet you can purchase any of the 4 currencies instantly. However if you plan on moving this Cyrpto anywhere else look forward for up to 24hr delays. Ironic considering blockchain technology is supposed to be near instant transfer time.

The user identification system is faulty, and you end up having to call to get your drivers license verified manually. In addition they make you wait another 24 hours after it's verified. It's been so frustrating to use, I'm no longer interested in investing in the crypto market. When you call, they send your call to India to someone who is actively using a translator to transcribe the questions you are asking, so there is a long pause after asking a question before the representative knows what your talking about, and even then, they ask 20 questions about something really simple.

Then when I got it there the gas fees to sell it or trade it were 60% of the coin value. Eventually after a couple days of trying different coins to trade with it I found one that was only a 10% gas fee… after I already had lost hundreds… the biggest takeaway from this experience is that I bought the coin on this app and the next day couldn’t sell it, then when I contacted customer support they were absolutely no help, all they could tell me was that it wasn’t sellable on the app in my area… duh… they should reimburse me because I have no problem losing money to a bad pick but to lose money because they wouldn’t allow a trade the day after I bought it… that should be illegal, that nonsense could easily be manipulated to steal money from people."
coinbase,ios,Hope3nder,5,2021-05-11 12:20:32,"This app is ruined by its lack of details and explanations. Their page has a chart that lists which payment methods will allow for instant sending of your coin etc. One of them was PayPal, so I went with that thinking my funds will be available instantly because Coinbase stated so on their page. Well, that was a lie. It’s been almost an hour, and I still see no funds available for me to send — it shows “0”. An already terrible situation made worse by Coinbase’s lack of details and explanation. I don’t know WHY my money is being held, and there is no explanation for it. I’ll think twice before storing anything in coinbase from now on. I would give you 0 score if I could. Just terrible"
coinbase,ios,bahemoth,1,2023-01-22 11:35:14,"I originally downloaded coin base because of their advertisement that you can get free crypto simply by learning about it. After I signed up with them I found out that’s just not true I have not been able to earn anything like that. I then decided to go ahead and put a small amount into crypto so I bought a couple different ones. They charged me 50% online it says they only charge half of a percent but that’s not true they took half of what I put in.

Update.

I kept the app for some time and built a bit of money in it slowly. That was fine until I went to close my account and withdraw my funds. After several weeks of trying and after talking to multiple reps I finally was able to close my account but I had to forfeit the money in there because I wasn’t allowed to withdraw it all. This is really the biggest scam I have ever fallen for. I’m just happy my account won’t occur anymore charges from them."

I hope coinbase invests in hiring more people in those areas. I do not have full confidence in the security of my holdings if I’m compromised on my end, coinbase does little to offer me assurances. If you get hacked then chances are they will be in and out faster than you. You will be stuck dealing with the aftermath for ages while coinbase will be slow to respond or halt fraudulent or suspicious activities. If I can prove that I was hacked I want a guarantee that coinbase will credit the stolen funds and that it won’t just be stuck all being my fault. This is a security that people will pay for, if offered."
coinbase,ios,i only post bad reviews,1,2021-10-28 18:15:11,"This is solely based off the support system for this app. 

I have not been able to trade since I’ve downloaded the app a year ago. I set up my banking information added $10 to test it out and immediately after I was confirmed, I was restricted and my account was disabled from trading. I tried to read through the Q&A myself to see if I could find the issue. I could not. Thinking it was a glitch or bug I deleted the app and forgot about it the last few months. 

I re-downloaded it today (months later)  hoping to start trading but my account is still restricted. (Even though I’ve put money in it they stole the 10 I added when I first downloaded the app. Because it’s not there now.) But their support system will ask you two questions and you’re able to give one word answers (convenient) then it’ll disconnect the chat and send you to a message board.

 Why have the automated chat if we have to go to a inquiry board and hand fill it out anyways ? It’s not to better help direct questions to the correct person because you have the option to change that. And why have the automated chat if we’re still going to be put on a email complaint list that won’t get back to anyone till a year later? 

 I’m only posting here hoping I don’t have to wait another year before I can get my account properly activated"

This  unsupportive platform need to work on putting there customer needs first! They don’t have a direct line to contact them unless you have a Coinbase card. And online support hasn’t given any information on this transfer issue. Attempting to transfer my crypto from Coinbase has been a hassle with no update on their end.

But the second you decide you want to buy, sell or especially send/receive digital currency, the nightmare will begin. You will be asked to verify your identity no less than 15 times during your stay with Coinbase. And each time you finally get it to work, a week later it will all disappear and you will have to submit it all again. During that time, they will lock you out of your funds and not allow you to send or receive anything. Also, there is virtually no customer support with this company. If you run into errors or problems with the platform (and you will), they will not help you with anything over the phone and they very rarely reply to emails. I would say to stay far away from this company, but you really don’t have any other choice if looking to buy digital currency while also being able to send/receive it. Good luck."

Just look up what others are saying, many are having similar issues but they don’t seem to care

Update: I’ve come to the conclusion as I previously said, the employees just don’t seem to care or don’t know what they’re doing. I did everything they told me but I never received a verification email. They said that they THEMSELVES would send an email directly to me and to no surprise, no email. They didn’t  resolve my issue or give a real explanation, but they were quick to end my chat with them. At this point I’m taking my business elsewhere, it shouldn’t be this much of a hassle just to get verified. STAY AWAY FROM COINBASE"
coinbase,ios,MrMentalMikeY,3,2022-11-16 13:04:08,"Whereas I enjoy the layout of the page, many functions are difficult at times. For instance, I can’t send a token out. It keeps saying it has pasted my address but it has not. Little glitches like this.
You put in a max purchase and it does not accept when you think it has because once it adds the coin base fee is now more than what’s in your account and you don’t realize this.
Overall it’s good. If for some reason your bank declines a $10 deposit and you have $100,000 in assets in your Coinbase account, they will lock you out for upwards of five days! Even though you have that much money in there, your assets will be frozen.
Yes they have the regulatory coverage of United States were as offshore do not. But, I would use multiple platforms. Because Coinbase can be extremely frustrating."
coinbase,ios,aucar301,1,2022-08-05 02:59:35,"So I stopped using this app months ago when cryptocurrencies started crashing earlier in the year. Out of the blue, I received a charge for a coinbase pro subscription that I had never subscribed to. I had no funds in my account and hadn’t even opened the app in months. I called customer support to request a refund for this charge and was told I could not get a refund because coinbase pro subscriptions are non-refundable. I was told to file a complaint which I did.  I received no follow up or call back number to address this issue. Less than two hours later I received an e-mail saying that my complaint had been reviewed and I would not be receiving a refund. I understand that crypto is not doing so well right now and Coinbase probably needs all the money they can get…but charging my card without my consent is completely unacceptable.

coinbase,ios,notacheesefan,1,2022-07-21 05:09:46,"It’s all fun and games until they randomly decide to lock your funds up, claiming “security”. It was not my first time using Coinbase, nor the bank account associated through Coinbase. I even used it the day before and I was able to transfer my funds just fine. However, this time they decide to put a “security” lock on my funds with no way to revoke the lock. This resulted in potentially thousands of dollars worth of missed opportunities and all I can do is accept that because “security”. If you need to put a security lock on someone’s account, a simple verification of your identity should be enough.

Edit: I’m an idiot. I told my self I’d never use Coinbase again and I did. Go figure, it ended up being another terrible experience. 4 failed transactions later and I’m still unable to send my own money to myself.

2. Transfer holds for days after payments are cleared is ridiculous. It’s like you’re holding my money hostage in the hopes I might buy something more. I won’t buy something else, though, because [see number 1].
3. No ability to choose a limit price. Other exchanges are basically dictating the prices of these coins and your customers are being forced to place limitless orders, which may or may not really screw them over. Limits should be reasonable because frankly, [see number 1] and we are paying way over market value when all is said and done.

After signing up during a promotion “Earn $5 of Bitcoin” by signing up from the add plastered all over my social media, and after verifying my account by naively soliciting my personal information to this “accredited” trading platform, my account was immediately suspended for no provided reason, other than an email notification telling me my account was deleted. What a SCAM!

Apparently if you want to convert from one coin to another you need to withdraw to fiat currency. There appears however to be no way to do this internally since you can not buy coin from the cash wallet, only through a linked bank account or debit card. Each one of these transfers generates additional fees—great for Coinbase—bad for the investor who wishes to change holdings on a timely basis. The app developers need to make it possible to purchase coin from the internal cash wallet. Just saying..."

Would you want to trade ethereum to bitcoin? Done in a second.  Wana buy 500$ of doge and convert to stellar lumens and then back to doge? In a moment.

coinbase,ios,Winlogic,1,2023-05-01 07:30:24,"If you don’t mind having your account put on hold (unable to send crypto out of Coinbase) then Coinbase is probably a fine platform for you. 

However, I do mind having my money frozen. ACH deposits will always be put on hold. The way around that is to use a debit card so the transaction clears instantly and you (in theory) should be able to send your crypto out of Coinbase right away. But Coinbase will make up all kinds of reasons to put your account on hold so that you can’t send out crypto. 1st they put a 3 day hold on my account to verify my ID (which I had already done when I opened the account). They asked me to do this 3 times! I have a normal state driver’s license and the pictures were crystal clear. Then once they verified that (again), they put my account on hold for 24 hours stating they didn’t recognize my IP address. I’ve been using the same iPhone for years. I don’t use VPN and I use the Coinbase app. I tried to make my case in a support chat, but they don’t care. 

They say it’s for your own “safety,” that they put it on hold, yet your bank wouldn’t do that to you! Honestly, I bank with BoA and I’ve never had them freeze my account and ask me to reverify my ID or because of an IP address. Coinbase just makes up reasons to lock your money and keep it on their platform.

Long version: I purchased Bitcoin today for a total of $1,000 because Coinbase stated that you could send up to $1,000 per day instantly. It was not until AFTER I made the purchase, I was informed I would need to verify my identity (which apparently I cannot do because I updated my ID today and only have a paper copy that Coinbase does not accept). Had they stated they were going to require this, I would not have made the purchase. 

Their site says they are available 24/7 via phone. This was a lie as the recording stated “At this time, live support is not available”. If this is the case, they should update this on their site. 

I contacted someone from their chat who was equally unable to be of service. It will take 3 days for this transaction to go through since they will not allow me to verify my identity (which is going to cost me around $100 in profit I would gained had I been able to transfer the funds sooner). I realize $100 isn’t much, but it’s the principle of the matter.

Take a look at KuCoin and how flawless it runs without any bugs, glitches or downtime. Ever. It’s really an app to mimic in this game. They have staking and lending and rewards and also sorts of features to keep their user engaged and immersed.

I seriously recommend making the app a bit more data oriented with some DYNAMIC CHARTS and even SORT options on the watchlist and coin explore pages.

A little finesse and you will surely reclaim millions of users who have left negative reviews based on their experiences. This was the first app that I really stuck with all the way through my many years in crypto and I’d love to see it flourish and blossom into a masterpiece.

You would think that with the astronomical transaction fees they charge that they could afford to pay for a customer service department to answer phones and also for the email customer support to respond to inquiries without relying on bots. Apparently you can only speak to a live person if you have a credit card with them. The rest of their customers aren’t important enough. I will not be using them again as soon as they release my funds which, for some reason, they’ve been holding for over 3 business days probably making money off of it in the stock market."

I don’t really like how certain crypto isn’t supported, but it does at least provide information about them. I also don’t like the process it takes to be able to recover your account, if you don’t have access to the phone number related to your account it will take a few days before you gain access again. There should be other features where you don’t have to solely rely on a phone number for account recovery. Other than that I have no complaints.

 One random day my account got hacked/compromised completely and I can’t even get in my account anymore. Coinbase doesn’t even have the decency to get back to me, being such a big company I figured it wouldn’t be that way. A lot of hard earned money and gains lost in an instant not to mention my SSN, BANK INFO and more so easily taken over from my control by someone with nothing but an automated voice call with coinbase and unresponsive emails from there customer service.

I was skeptical at the time, not specifically about Coinbase as much is placing my money in cryptocurrency investing in general, but after checking out reviews and references I decided to open an account with Coinbase. After four years queen bass has earned my trust by virtue of their efficient app, reliable content of the industry, and most importantly, on the occasions I have needed customer service help, they’ve been extremely responsive and helpful, which is not often the case when dealing with Internet-based only companies. Thank you Coinbase."
coinbase,ios,Drewnnnnnnnn,5,2017-10-05 05:40:49,"Coinbase is great at selling you BTC/LTC/ETH. And they do a pretty good job of allowing you to sell on their exchange. But that’s about it. The app leaves a ton to be desired in the areas of tax reporting, understanding profits/losses, documenting buying/selling fees (which are tax deductible, but you better write them down bc they are recorded nowhere after the initial purchase/sale), and some basic and advanced chart analytics (like volume, highs/lows, etc.)

They are king and on top here in the US, but this space is ripe for disruption if a competitor launch in more fully featured exchange app that was blessed off by SEC and regulators. I hope Coinbase continues to improve and provide advanced functionality. Lord knows they’re collecting enough in fees to finance some of these suggested improvements."

Their “selfie” feature doesn’t work, and while you have the option to upload images of your DL, you do not have the option to upload your selfie. I called customer support, who was worthless because he insisted the upload option is there. No, it is not. It is for the drivers license, NOT for the selfie. Which would be fine, if the photo-taking for the selfie on their platform worked correctly. But it doesn’t.

So here I am, locked out of my account indefinitely. The moment I get back in, if I even do, I am moving everything out of Coinbase and going elsewhere. 

I wouldn’t be so angry if customer support was helpful at all, but they are equally oblivious to the problems with their platform and completely unhelpful. An hour later and I’m still waiting for the email I was promised immediately after ending the phone call."

I didn’t update or log into my account for nearly 2 years I just watched a small balance. Then I wished to purchase coins again, I had a very great experience resetting my password and being able to have control of my wallet. It took a little time; about 20-30 minutes to cross reference and verify it was my wallet I was accessing and bringing back to life. This absolutely sold me on the reliability of this app. Coinbase could be the best service I have used in 2020. In uncertain times it’s very beneficial to have a partner likeCoinbase watching a small amount of my assets. Thanks for being reliable.

coinbase,ios,aceNOLO,1,2025-03-25 09:46:12,"I made a debit card deposit about 36 hours ago and it still says pending. I contacted support to find out what the hold up is, and first they tried to act like I never withdrew hundreds from my bank. Then they suddenly “found” the deposit, but couldn’t say why my transaction has been pending for all this time. All they could tell me was keep waiting.

Well then you need to update the information on the app because it says debit transactions go through instantly. This is NOT a problem on my banks end, the money left my account instantly and is not pending, the transaction is complete. Coinbase is HOLDING my money, for no apparent reason. There’s too many other platforms available that I’ve never had this problem with. I can guarantee this will never happen again. Deposit is still pending 5 days later, effectively making my last deposit. Now GIVE ME MY MONEY so I can transfer it out."
coinbase,ios,Lou.2019,1,2021-09-08 15:38:46,"The crypto market decreased significantly yesterday and I bought ETH, ADA, and XLM while they were cheap. All three of my transactions showed as pending but now I can’t find any evidence of those transactions. I believe they were all simply cancelled but I’ve had zero communication from Coinbase to confirm that, so I am unsure if that money will be withdrawn from my bank account. Shortly after I placed these transactions the market began to increase again so I missed the opportunity to make money during the dip. I am extremely frustrated - if I can’t take advantage of low prices then what is the point? I will be doing some research and taking my business elsewhere. The crypto market is volatile and if their servers cannot handle the increase in activity then I cannot trust this company with my money. I have seen so many similar complaints from others on Twitter that experienced the exact same problem."

The online version shows your account value simplified into a graph I want that on the app. The app craps itself when the market gets VOLATILE! So if you suspect a selloff in a crypto be ready to have already sold because if a large selloff comes you’ll be stuck with no out unless you run to your computer. The wallet page on the app is nice but I wish the crypto I had money in would be stacked at the top instead of me having to scroll through to find the wallet, Im saying SORT button. it’s a great app 4/5 stars. wish too see Coinbase Pro soon for it’s the more serious traders."
coinbase,ios,WhyseGuy,1,2017-12-12 14:29:32,"So the app is cool but could definitely be improved. If you’re new to crypto currency then Coinbase is a great place to start. It really simplify things...oversimplifies.  

For example, there is information present on your web-based account that isn’t in the app (like when the cryto currency you bought is actually going to show up in your account...I had no clue it would take a week from purchase to actually see the currency hit your wallet). There are also limited discretionary warnings to inform you of such issues (given my previous example, the little as ‘30 minutes’ before your wallet updates is just not true). 

Lastly, you can’t actually access support from the app. It sends you to the website, make you log in again, somehow make you log in one more time and then finally you can talk to a bot that really isn’t all that helpful. Also, if you log out of the app, upon logging on again, you have to set everything again (passcodes, price alarms) forcing you to constantly have the app going in the background. 

My overall opinion, what’s the point of having an app, outside of spot checking prices...which some will argue you should not be CONSTANTLY checking anyhow, if it has far less usability than the website?

I’m done, for now.

***UPDATE***

The app is TRASH!!! Good for checking prices quickly. Beyond that, just use the website."
coinbase,ios,integrity&love,1,2024-11-09 19:42:41,"Coinbase has absolutely no process in place for addressing dust attacks. Their only response is to tell the user to not move that crypto, which essentially means that my ETH is stuck indefinitely in my coinbase wallet because there are dust ETH transactions that are in the same wallet and Coinbase hasn’t done anything about them and keeps giving me the same generic response and avoids answering my direct questions. I called and emailed customer support multiple times and they simply gave me a generic non-response regarding the dust transactions that affect my ability to move my real ETH crypto. Then proceeded to close the case without actually helping me. No real help whatsoever and now my ETH is stuck unless I want to be tracked by whoever sent me all those ETH dust transactions. Horrible customer support. Generic repetitive responses. Lack of actual care and realness. Lack of action toward addressing the core issue and no plan in place to fix it. Don’t use Coinbase!"

Subsequent attempts to purchase were declined due to suspicious activity. This does not and has not happened with any of the other 4 crypto brokers I use. 

Got my account verified by sending the required front and back of drivers license, reconnected each account and still unable to complete transaction. 

I contacted customer service, they took a week to respond, asking me to verify my account and this time they want me to send them my drivers license again and “realtime” selfie? 

Oddly enough, my debit card magically started working and now I have up to a $100 dollar purchasing limit, which I will just stick to from now on.🙄

There is KYC, and there is intrusion. Coinbase would be so much better if they learn the difference between the two. 

My brother and a friend had the same problem and it was fixed on the Coinbase side of things, no selfies involved. What’s up with that? Some females aren’t comfortable sending “real-time selfie’s to companies. My brother and male friend didn’t have this extra hoop to jump through. 🤷‍♀️"

Coinbase made an unauthorized debit to my account therefore overdrafting it and when I reached out three days ago, they still haven’t responded. If their customer service wasn’t a pile of garbage then the review would’ve been quite good, but alas, they need to learn how to manage that end of their application.

I would try several different ways but none would ever work I would also wait several days but nothing ever worked.

That said, I have rated this 4 stars as I think there is one feature that it would be helpful to have added.  This would be the ability to set an “price up to” or a “price falls below price” alert like you can do in the stock trading Fidelity app.  This way, we can assign a price that we’d want to buy or sell at for a respective coin and have the app send a notification when it hits those marks so we can logon to Coinbase and try to get in before the price either goes up or drops; depending on what your looking to get alerted about.

coinbase,ios,MrArmaniVuitton,3,2021-05-24 22:43:18,"Initially I attempted to link my bank account to purchase currencies; the app would say successfully linked but purchasing was never successful and it would tell me to try another method of payment.
When I would retry, the app would insist the account is linked. After multiple attempts, I reached out to the support in which it took days for a response and finally a answer that did not resolve the issue.
Ultimately I used my card, but it is limited to $750 a time in which I have to pay a fee every time to equal the amount I would do one time if the system would allow me to use my bank account. For example a $3,000 purchase now has to be broken down to 4 $750 payments at around $28 dollars a piece in fees...so basically $114 in fees that would have just been 1 $28 dollar fee."

It’s one of your 4 favorites but it’s only 90¢ and rank 62 on the platform you will have to scroll to find it if you want to say transfer some of your Bitcoin to it in the select menu.

There is no way to get a full view or a detailed view by drilling in or out, same problem exists across their two online integrated platforms. My only guess is that it keeps them from being liable while banking on your losses. I’ve been using Coinbase for 9 years. Let me reiterate, other than a wallet exchange this is the worst trading platform I’ve encountered, and I’ve given it 9 years. Good thing for them, you in the US have few other options."

The other account is inaccurate b/c I’ve never had an account with the bank listed. Apple Pay is listed as a payment method with $300 off to the side, do those amounts mean Coinbase is trying to pull that amount of $ from those accounts or does it mean that’s the max that can be transferred in &/or out of Coinbase?

One is that when you want to convert one currency to another, it’ll tell you that there is no fee however you will not be receiving the same value of the new currency. This is not very transparent and I feel like poor business standards. I’d rather get exactly what I am converting and see clearly the fee that I am being charged than have it disguised in this way. The second is trying to send funds to a different wallet address. I’ll enter the amount that is available after factoring in their fee but it says that I still don’t have enough to make the transaction. Makes no sense.

coinbase,ios,Jasper Ash,4,2020-12-11 20:46:36,Coinbase is great for those new to crypto. The fees are a little on the higher side of exchanges but I personally don’t mind paying the fee for the easy to use app interface and the ability to take full custody of your tokens and assets. The Coinbase Earn program is a great way to learn about crypto while earning a few tokens here and there. I would love to see a limit buy/sell option to make dollar cost averaging more profitable but I guess that’s where an exchange like Coinbase Pro and Kraken become beneficial. Coinbase has a bad reputation for app crashes when Bitcoin is making big moves up or down due to heavy traffic. This also makes it difficult to maximize profits when you can’t buy the dip due to app issues. But overall it’s a great app for those new to the crypto space.

First, the transaction fee for sending btc is outrageous- over 20%. But that’s fine, whatever. 
I sent two amounts to an online company to complete a purchase. The second one went through in about 6 hours, but the first one (for all of $60) was “pending” for over 26 hours and my window to make payment closed. As soon as the window closed, my transaction finally went through 
During that time I submitted multiple requests to customer service- no help. Just a canned response directing me to their (no) help page. I responded explaining the timing issue- no response. I sent another message showing that my window had expired and asked for my transaction fee to be returned- no response. 
Fortunately the 3rd party receiving the btc returned them (charging me another fee) was charged $25 to send two small amounts and then $15 for them to be returned... all because this app couldn’t complete my transaction and the “customer support” didn’t think my issue was worthy of their time. 
I respectfully asked for the company to make it right and at least refund my transaction fees on their end- no response.

I got charged $28 for sending $72!!! What the hell is that?! That's WELL over a 30% charge in FEES just to send a currency over. Not to mention just to make trading worth while, you must make over 5% in equity because 2% will always go to them for buying and an additional 2-5% or more to them when they sell your cryptocurrency for a much lower value than the actual value. For example, BTC will be valued at $15,900 and they will sell your BTC to you for $15,500 and keep the $400 value in BTC for themselves. That's another 3% they are taking!!! So really I would suggest long buy and holds and when you sell, make sure you're WELL over 10% in gains before touching Coinbase. THEFT And misrepresentation is what they focus on."

You will be searching the dashboard of a 747 to make that simple purchase.  Networks, wallets, currencies, other apps, etc are all exposed, just to buy your disk drive from China.

There is a simple mode switch, except it probably won’t let you do what you need.  Useful information, like how much of your deposit is immediately available (while any banking app shows you) are actually hidden away - in fact you’ll get an email saying it’s all available NOW.  Only after you’ve searched through enough possible reasons why things aren’t working and stumble onto a topic like transaction holds do you get presented with the exact info and specific amount of the hold that’s screwing things up - if you are logged in… coinbase knew, just wouldn’t put it on any of the screens.  

I know this is more than an app review issue, but since Coinbase doesn’t really have a way to contact anyone for support (we always have high volume of calls), and no email, this seems like a good place."
coinbase,ios,Josephmc44,1,2024-02-18 20:03:16,"I was using Coinbase for years and then one day they decided to completely wipe out all of my “all time returns”. I waited patiently for a bitcoin to rise in price so I can make my money back and finally when it did, Coinbase decided to completely steal the money I was waiting to re-accumulate. I went on one day and it was like it was never there. When I called customer support. The guy on the other end of the line was literally raising his voice at me just because I had a few questions to ask him about the situation. COINBASE STOLE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS FROM ME AND THEN TRIED TO ACT LIKE I WAS A CRAZY PERSON FOR EVEN ASKING ABOUT IT. LUCKILY I TAKE A LOT OF SCREENSHOTS AND I HAVE SCREENSHOTS SHOWING EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED. I WILL SUE THIS COMPANY AND I WILL GET MY THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS BACK!!! 
I honestly can’t believe I’m even having to deal with this. What a waste of my time and effort. The world‘s hard enough and now some multimillion dollar company is going to try to scam some little peasant. Unbelievable!!!"

I get referred to support over email.. they will send you a email.. and 2 hours later if you don’t respond they send a follow up saying they are closing the case.. then you get to start the process all over again.

My account is a few years old.  Super high fees.  Buy up to 1000 usd crypto with just a lot of fees sometimes available immediately.  After that they lock it and hold it for 7 days.  I wired 70k to avoid huge fees, they held one day sent it back said 1-3 day hold time sending it back.  Waited 1 hr to talk to human.    Human really nice but cant tell me anything.  Escalated service request from human.  Had to wait for email resolution.  Email resolution was robot response with suggestions to faq page. 

Use coinbase for transactions less than 1k per week and pay super high fees, other than than that, buy your investments with a plan where the price will be in 7 days and hope it doesn’t fall too bad while they have it locked up because youre gonna eat it, and there’s nothing you can do about it but read the faq pages."

Last year in 2020 the app was relatively good and easy to use quick response of the whole 9 yards. It’s 2021 it’s been progressively getting worse it’s so bad it locks up doesn’t want to react doesn’t want to do whatever I need to have done on a very consistent basis so with that said it’s very poor performance and I downloaded it now for the first time I would never use it again."

For 2 weeks I have tried my DL photo upload good then message need more time to verify let u know in 24 hours! For 2 weeks every day 4-5 times a day I try and it won’t let me buy !! Had my son try to help said it went through guess what it shows I am registered when I sign in but it does it again saying need more verification then fail and wait 24 hours . All my family members are having NO trouble and logged right in  7 of them they are buying but oh no not me. And yes zodiac try on computer not just phone still doing it. Even deleted Coinbase app but it did same when I logged  back in. I sent messages through customer help center no answer so customer service if you are reading this now can you help me ?
coinbase,ios,Isaiah Adkins,1,2021-01-07 14:36:46,Please I recommend never using this app (Cashapp is 10x easier) because first if you put funds in and try to withdraw you will not see those funds for awhile while withdrawing they will say you don’t have the right amount but it’s clearly in your portfolio just trust me and never use this app they’re terrible and especially after COVID with no support team or number well there is but it’s a fraud prevention number so when you call before you even speak to someone they ask for information and will try and lock your account screw that I want my money and second the support page would be understandable if it worked but it’s stupid I had to learn how to use my account better from these bad reviews on here they’ll say they have email support on the customer support page but when they answer your email they will refer you back to the same stupid page that couldn’t answer your question in the first place point stated DONT USE COINBASE

You don’t need thousands or even hundreds off dollars to start there are no minimums or membership fees! I would definitely highly recommend getting the upgrade it’d 1 dollar a day but allows you unlimited amount of trades per day with zero fees.. this is a really great way weather you’re just getting started and want a very simple way to buy cryptos or if your already in check out the unlimited fee free trading upgrade- NO minimum requirement to leave “on account” .

Are there hold times & waiting periods to get your money? Yes, but we're talking up to a week or a couple of days, we are not talking scam territory here and regardless of little fees and operating costs i've still made money thank-fully even a lil bit with Ethereum too. This is a great app. The easiest and safest way to buy/sell/trade crypto. Don't listen to the negative reviews. They don't know how to play the game. YES you can LOSE MONEY, BUT you can also MAKE MONEY. No risk, no reward. Get that coin. 💸 Fun app especially the quick price updates."

The online chat support is beyond a joke, they give you ever answer from “delete your app and reinstall it” to “your profile name isn’t 100% the same as you account name” but no solution to how to change it and the app won’t let. Phone support is a tad better although they just want you off of the phone asap and give the same basic generic responses. Email support is the most frustrating; they say they found the problem and will transfer the ticket to someone that can help then the next day you get an email saying the case has been closed and you get no solution. And devs don’t bother asking me to amend my review with my ticket number because I’ve been down that road with you on my account and you never got back to me either. WORST SERVICE IMAGINABLE"

I tried to restart the app and even redownload it as well. I tested my camera and my iPhone camera was working just not in the app. So I tried to reach out to customer service. Instead of addressing the issue I had they told me oh I need to verify my address and here are the documents they need me to upload. I responded to the email with a question about the documents and was ignored for a month and finally I get an email saying if I don’t respond they will close my case. I sent another immediately explaining it was an issue with the actual app. Tonight they sent me a feedback email asking if they helped me. I revived zero help. Maybe the camera works for others but it didn’t for me and when I asked for help I got nothing.

Customer service is actually very helpful. If emailed correctly responses I’ve experienced are around a full work day to a  day but never more.

I will say that they are a very user friendly app. Everything is easily laid out and easy to read so for that I give 5 stars. But I just can’t overlook the fees and other issues. 

Fees to deposit money from your card, fees to trade, fees to convert, fees to take out your money. Then on top of that I have two cards that I have registered with Coinbase but they won’t allow me to actually use them to buy anything. My bank account is linked yet the system won’t allow me to transfer money. Problems on top of problems for me and family so I’d say find an exchange that isn’t going to scrape as much money from you as these guys do."

The platform emailed me about the issue and asked me if I have traveled recently. I emailed back and said no, I haven’t traveled anywhere in the past two years. The customer service provided me the location, time of withdrawal IP address, but never stopped the process. When I called and asked them why they didn’t stop, they said it was too late, the withdrawal has already went through. Than I told them that coinbase is responsible for keeping people’s accounts safe and secure. But there response was. “The customers is responsible to keep their accounts safe and secure” now I am restricted from my own account but the coinbase has let the hacker steal all my funds from my account with zero attempt to stop it.

If you have a VPN, make sure you turn it off to deal with any of the re-signing in but even now that doesn’t work. like I said above when things are running smooth with the Coinbase app, everything is fine, but when it doesn’t let you in, prepare yourself for a royal pain for a few days/weeks of dealing with the situation."

I do what they ask and send the documents, then 5 days later while I also have thousands of dollars in there that are now basically locked away, they finally contact me and say the the bank statement I sent isn’t valid because they don’t accept bank statements from credit unions… then I can’t get a hold of anybody for over a week, I emailed at least 3 or 4 times talked to multiple robots and no agents and that was that.

For example my accounts been locked for two weeks now (after using for the past two years) with no explanation at all. I have assets such as litecoin just sitting there, unable to transfer, unable to sell, unable to do anything with. When i contact support they just say that theres nothing they can do and that the team will review. Ive now lost money due to this and theres nothing i can do about it.

coinbase,ios,Russkie47,1,2021-09-07 23:20:23,"When it comes to looking for a proper exchange for crypto or any other needs, the most important aspect is reliability. I foolishly thought that, by being charged fees on every purchase or sell, this meant Coinbase would be superior than Robinhood which offered free trading. And how wrong I was. Your ability to buy on the app has been down on a day when the crypto market flash crashed and several saw this as a prime opportunity to “buy the dip.” Coinbase did their part by crashing themselves for 6 hours and counting. 

Not only is that unacceptable, they still haven’t resolved the hold on my bank for when I attempted to purchase crypto… 6 hours ago. According to many others, it will most likely get canceled, effectively holding my money hostage while the market continues to go back up. For those looking for a reliable service, look elsewhere because Coinbase is a joke."

The trading platform it self it’s very clean and easy to work with. My purchase power limit its very week and I have plenty of funds but I can only buy x amount per week, this system of purchase it’s frustrating. But my main concern is if there’s a major problem there’s no one to talk to for customers service over the phone. This company needs improvement quickly on this matter."

I’ve been emailing them for 2 weeks because they haven’t responded at all. After 2 weeks I get an email saying my case has been closed?? I’m still locked out of my old account. Every time I call they say they will forward it to a specialist and that they will email me when they can and now the case is closed without them even resolving it???? Now whenever I call I have to be on hold for 15 minutes before getting hung up on. I can’t get through to anyone now. So I guess my money is gone and I’ll never get it back. Don’t waist your time with this app! If you ever get a new phone number or lose your phone they will avoid you and won’t help at all.

Tried to contact support which takes one to 3 days and each response I get is unacceptable and doesn’t resolve the issue.  They have been down quite a bit and sure overwhelmed due to the recent popularity explosion and uprise of Bitcoin value but come on get some technical help and more support personnel you guys are making a fortune right now you can afford it!

Instead they add unnecessary steps and additional transaction fees that they deceitfully describe as network fees. To which the lightning network virtually has zero. Reached out on chat to Customer Service and spent over two hours and got absolutely no resolution. It took the first 40 minutes for the agent to understand the problem as it was being explained and another hour and a half on chat being periodically updated as they stated they were in contact with Support trying to find a resolution.

I am now 3 days in to trying to contact support and have gotten nowhere. None of their articles offer any solution either. When calling, it says my wait time is at least an hour.

But, as with any exchange, only if it’s locked up in an order and not just sitting on the exchange in the exchange wallet. The Coinbase wallet syncs up seamlessly and is very convenient. Only issue I have with the Coinbase app is that there is a little latency with the app when trading heats up but..most apps get like that.

Coinbase’s rewards section promotes a better informed  community through gamification. 

The app is frequently updated. I do wish they would return the feature that allowed users to sort their assets by growth, market cap, or volume. I also miss being able to quickly see my returns in the asset list.  Not sure why these features were removed, but the app was better when I could view such details at a glance."

(iPad Pro users with keyboards would appreciate this, I’m sure.) Tried CoinbasePro and couldn’t sync my account/wallets to it, which I’m okay with calling a user error as I didn’t spend too much time looking into it.

coinbase,ios,Whatswiththecat,2,2023-12-09 01:42:30,"Overall, I think CoinBase is very well designed and user friendly, but there are minor issues that can cause dramatic change, especially when it’s involving money. The biggest reason for my low rating is that I’ve held XRP for years. I had entered into XRP before it had closed trading because of the case with the SEC. I had been following the situation for years on my own because the only thing CoinBase would notify me of, are NFTs which I’ve shown no interest in, or other Crypto that I’ve never traded. But the moment XRP is opened for trading after the lawsuit ends, silence. No warning, no notification, nothing. Price skyrocketed and by the time I had noticed that day, it had dropped significantly.

CoinBase is real capable of advertising the crypto plight that is NFTs every single day but the moment it’s something I’m actually invested in, there’s no noise."
coinbase,ios,no idea 444,2,2022-04-29 09:08:26,They shave off the buying and selling prices listed when you trade. I have a few different accounts including Coinbase pro. I’ll trade at the exact same time on both accounts and only make 7-8 percent on my Coinbase account and make 10 percent on my Coinbase pro account. I pay a transaction fee on each Coinbase pro trade. I pay $30 a month on my Coinbase account for free trades but it’s not really free because the poor buying and selling prices make up for it. Example: a coin is selling for 1.00 on both platforms. I buy a coin for 1.00 on Coinbase pro for 1.00 minus fees turns out to be .95. On Coinbase I do the same purchase within one minute of the first on Coinbase pro and I get the same .95 on Coinbase even with free trades that paid for. It’s a rip off. They make up for the “free trade” by skimming off the sale and buying prices. Try it out.

Many news reports about this.  I transferred money back to my bank account. App says completed.  No money was received at my bank account. They told me to call my bank. Not their problem.  Their support is pretty much non existent.  Starts with a useless bot to waste your time. Ask for a real person and get another bot with a name. Call and get support from India that reads screens from a bot and cannot find any answers. Avoid the aggravation. Trades limited to simple market orders.

But w.e and I accepted the fee. That put it in a “US dollar cash account” (not the one that gains interest. Just a holder for my cash. Today I try to cash it and it says there’s another high fee to send to my bank. I went to contact them and it says there’s an over 4 HOUR WAIT on the phone. I tried to contact by chat and an annoying bot with no helpful info would NOT transfer me to a live agent. I somehow, after 30 minutes, got it to do so.

I moved to a different state and changed my number, so there was a time I couldn’t sign in to my account. I tried calling but couldn’t talk to a human representative. Sending an e-mail to Coinbase support was a process, and the first few responses seem like if it was automated by a bot. I was able to respond to one of the e-mails and express my frustration. I finally got responses from Coinbase support vía e-mail. They gave me 2 methods and 1 worked. I finally have access to my account again. 
Other than that, Coinbase is easy to use. It’s good for people starting out. The fees are a bit high in my opinion. They definitely take security seriously."

Update: Dev responded and told me to delete the app, which I did. Then, I was able to log in. All was good. Couple days later, the app asked me to log in again. And now it’s the same problem again - it logs in and kicks me out. So I have to basically delete the app and reinstall every time I want to log in. 

I can’t for the life of me figure out why they did away with Coinbase Pro (formerly GDAX). I used it via a browser for several years and it was my favorite way to trade. This new Coinbase app and advanced trading is just beyond terrible. Worst crypto app of all. Extremely confusing. I have no idea how place an order or how to deposit/withdraw my funds."
coinbase,ios,bwisc,4,2021-05-13 16:04:58,I love trading on Coinbase so far and have really enjoyed all the resources available but it doesn’t keep you updated on what your average price is or specific details about your own portfolio. It gives you details on the crypto itself but doesn’t specify how it relates back to your account and what you have invested. You can go and look at the individual details of each transaction you complete but if you have multiple transactions with a specific crypto it doesn’t put those together to tell you how much you have and at what average price you have it. A couple other things along those lines exist in the app (hoping it changes moving forward) but all in all it’s a good app.
coinbase,ios,Schwalmy,4,2017-12-10 16:10:12,"The setup is extremely easy and it seems fairly secure so far. There is something you need to understand about pricing though. The buy and sell prices have fees of about 1.5% for all trades on top of the $1 fee they show you. This means when the value is listed at $145 for LTC, you pay about $147 and vice versa for selling. This percent fee is not directly shown but instead modified the per coin price when buying or selling.

This is still a great app for managing funds but with a little extra time and patience to learn a little more, this app is best paired with GDAX. They are owned by the same company and funds can be directly transferred for free between GDAX and Coinbase. Use GDAX for precise trading and Coinbase for more long term trading and mobile management of funds."
coinbase,ios,guapppoppo,1,2023-04-03 23:04:45,i had been trading on coinbase for a year & out of nowhere they put a hold on my account saying account under review even tho I already verified my account and had been using it for over a year. I couldnt access my money for over 3 years I filed a complaint and was in the process of taking them to small claims court. they just unlocked my account today & all my assets dropped in price since i’ve been locked out so i only got half my money back. moral of the story don’t put your money in their hands. I had over $400 in my account at the time & over those years I was out of work for a while and needed my money but couldn't access it. i had to take out a small loan to pay a bill which is ridiculous. I just got my money back & the balance went down to $212 since bitcoin and etherum went down tremendously 😔 i cant stress this enough DONT USE COINBASE!!
coinbase,ios,It's kinda almost alright,5,2021-09-04 21:16:58,"Coinbase got me into crypto back in 2017, and wow, it’s been quite the ride. Throughout the journey, Coinbase has been improving and getting faster and more efficient since I first downloaded it, and I love the new assets coming in every so often. The UI is also super easy to navigate and very professional looking, I would recommend Coinbase to anyone looking to get into crypto, as it’s a great place to start. One thing I wish the devs would add, however, is a profit/loss over the day/all-time. It would be nice to see how well my investments are doing over time. Other than that though it’s a great app and I’ve never had any detrimental issues. 5/5 stars"
coinbase,ios,CoinbaseNickname,5,2021-06-04 01:03:53,"Probably for the best? It won’t let me add my banking account (routing and account number) even though I have had this bank account for over 20 years and have money in it. 🤷‍♀️ guess, if I do put in any money,It won’t be more than $100. Looks like people are having trouble with drawing. Surprising with all the good reviews. Perhaps at some thing I’m doing incorrectly, but I refuse to use Plaid. Even if Coinbase does not store that information, Plaid will have it, even if only for a brief moment and it’s encrypted. Nope. Perhaps someone can share their experience? If so and a test of a small amount works and they let me withdraw, I will update my review."
coinbase,ios,J12jhfutruc674754,3,2021-07-29 15:06:36,"This apps interface is very user friendly and good to learn the space for beginners. However, if (more like WHEN) you experience any issues (app bugs, system errors, unexplained account suspensions/restrictions all for absolutely no reason) Coinbase support only has a phone line for their card holders and that is it. You’re sole point of contact is a form online and hoping they get back to you within the month while all of your assets are frozen!! 

Start with Kraken or Gemini and save yourself the hassle later down the road. Everyone that has this problem has switched exchanges, however Coinbase makes this very hard for you to transfer funds (system error, application bug). So once you’re on Coinbase..you’re pretty much stuck there. AVOID AT ALL COST"
coinbase,ios,mixha3l,1,2020-03-25 20:48:42,"I started my first trade about a week ago. That day it asked for me to revering my identity. Since their system has misread my age and my name and disabled trading. It deleted my limit orders and have since missed out on several opportunities for good profits and have to hope the price doesn’t crash down again. Their support center took 4 days to escalate the situation and are now saying it will take at least 5-7 business days, maybe longer for the specialist to look at it. The Coinbase pro exchange itself is pretty good with low fees and good charting, just hope you never have an issue you want fixed in a timely manner.
*Update*
I’d verified finally. I have full access on the Coinbase brokerage but trading is still disabled on Coinbase pro. Every few days they tell me the issue is fixed when it is not. I notify them and they tell me it will be a few days more. Over a week of missed profits. Worst customer service ever."
coinbase,ios,Nate Allen,1,2017-12-28 20:56:59,"I used this app to invest a couple weeks ago. I invested almost $600 in bitcoin. I am a recent finance graduate and I knew bitcoin would go up in value for another week or so before crashing.

About a week and a half after I initially purchased, bitcoin began declining extremely rapidly. I tried to sell, as I had made a pretty good profit.

But as it turns out, Coinbase STILL HADN’T PROCESSED MY TRANSACTION. It said it was still “pending” because I used a bank account, not a card. It won’t let me sell. It’s been another week, and bitcoin has now dropped from $19,000 to $12,000, and I am STILL unable to sell. I am being forced to lose about $300 at this rate until my transaction goes through.

The very nature of the bitcoin market is that it’s a short term investment. Therefore, there is absolutely no reason it should take Coinbase 10 business days to process a transaction. At this rate, there’s a good chance I will lose over $300. 

Last thing: When you buy bitcoin, the price is always automatically inflated about 3% higher from what the graph represents. It won’t tell you the inflated price until after you select your payment method and amount, and then the price is magically higher. Conversely, the price deflates from the “current price” on the graph by about 3% every time you sell! Added up, that’s cutting into your profits by about 6%. Significant!!"

Turns out one of the transactions was $1.99, but showed as a temp auth as $1.00 so not the best way to verify if that happens... Next I put in my checking account info on a Friday. Says 2-3 business days temp charges but nothing as of Friday (the next week). Now I’m back again to try for the 3rd and final time... I get the temp auth charged via debit card and when I attempt to input the amounts I’m not able to click the “continue” button on the app because the keypad is blocking it and I’m unable to verify... 😡😡😡"
coinbase,ios,Tac Leung,5,2017-10-08 08:47:57,"The biggest feature of Coinbase is bitcoin key management that allows the rest of us non-cryptographically savvy civilians to participate in the blockchain. I upgraded all my devices since I bought coins in 2013 then didn’t think about it much again till recently when I had reason to trade and found that I lost my password. The Coinbase customer support system is a little tricky to navigate at first (especially if you activated two-factor authentication but no longer owned any of the registered devices like me). But once I made contact with Michael on their customer support team, I was back in my account in no time. The good news is that I had bought more bitcoin than I originally remember!"
coinbase,ios,Colleen97,5,2017-12-22 03:37:02,"Every time you use this exchange for anything they charge a fee... fine but you investments automatically go down. Then they add Bitcoin Cash, let you buy it but then say it can’t be bought or sold, yet of course the value keeps changing, and your investment loses money and you cannot sell... your money just disappears and your hands are tied because all you can do is watch. Then when they do open the selling back up it is obviously at a much lower price. You cannot sell when your vale goes up?  They want to steal your money like a bunch of crooks.  So, I guess if your lucky enough to have enough money to ride it all out, good for you but from what I see they are just stealing your money."

I had to re-link my bank account which went smoothly but when trying to purchase $500 of Cardano I received a message that they’re experiencing connection issues and to close the app and try again. I did that twice and after the third attempt was successful I found out that I now owned $1500 of Cardano and got hit with transaction fees that I should’ve never been charged. An email from them was a general form email. It’s only about $30 but how often does this happen? I trade with TD Ameritrade and they compensate for their mistakes.
Nothing has been done. I received an email on September 7 that they closed my case. They also will not release the almost $500 that is in my cash account that has been on hold for nearly a week. Coinbase has handled this very unprofessionally for a publicly traded company."

It’s extremely annoying that every couple days it seems to reset my preference to allow me to sign in with a pin or Face ID and therefore have to go through the entire authentication process again. If you need to contact support, good luck. They have a bot and it will eventually direct you to a contact us page if you ask for a human but the contact us page does not actually have a way for you to do so. Just another automated process where you input what your issue is based on different drop down menus and then “solutions” are provided. Seriously considering closing out my accounts this week because I don’t need to waste my time with a company that can’t figure out basic customer service."

They saved themselves a little money by not supporting the iPad in any form or fashion unless you count a little rectangle sitting in the middle of the screen a workable solution.

Fun fact: every second one of those messages won’t be delivered and then you get a note to please use another app to verify the coin base app. Every time you want to log into the app it’s  another SMS plus it’s failure plus a retry and maybe you get in. Just logging in doesn’t work. Most of the time you will see an alert telling you to try again in a couple of hours. And that is before you give them any money and trust them with your bank details. Oh, and absolutely no customer support. Yup. Crappy app, crappy service."
coinbase,ios,BrowserG,2,2021-04-13 05:03:56,"Coinbase and Coinbase Pro work for basic crypto currency trading but are missing a lot of basic features.  Want to place a limit order, you’ll have to do an instant transfer to Coinbase Pro.  But don’t be fooled by the name.  Coinbase Pro is less intuitive and provides nothing in terms of research, detailed price analysis, resistance levels, trending average price within a set period of time, and to trade, you have to get out of your portfolio wallet and trade from the market summary page which is confusing. For market orders, Coinbase, not Pro, is the most intuitive route.  Price alerts on either platform are severely lacking. Coinbase should merge the two apps and then toss them in the trash. Then get experienced traders with project management background to work with their IT teams to build a new robust, intuitive, leading edge platform."

The fees be pretty high if you ask me. Bought $500 worth of crypto and they charged me about $10 to buy then I gained a few bucks and decided to sell because I felt I was timing my trade wrong and they charged me like $7. I didn't make any gains after the fees. Good platform but they need to find a way to lower the fees. 

Also in your portfolio I would be nice to be shown the percentage of loss or gain and the amount in cash you gained but they don’t do that would be nice to add it. 

Other than that it’s a pretty good app and I like how they make it easy for people to get into crypto since I think it has so much potential and would like to see more people using it."

Everything is straight forward and they offer not only great advice but also keep you updated on everything current news as well as other valuable information and I love this.

You cannot speak to any real person unless you can login to the app. I have sent my picture of my valid id several times as well as a video and of course the response is that I cant be Identified with the same id I used to open the account. So now I can’t login to the app that has several thousands of dollars in it and you cannot get ahold of anyone there customer service is a joke.

    So listen carefully, do not rush, this app could easily teach you to increase wealth and income.  Do not “veg” out because you don’t understand.  You can take brief course of 5 minutes, then simply answer a multi choice question.  You will receive financial reward.

The amount they charge in fees an ridiculous especially with the amount of time it takes them to day anything while keeping your money hostage. If you buy a certain amount of coin to use to purchase something with it will hold most of it for a week. If it tells you you have a certain amount available to transfer you don’t actually have that amount because they are going to charge you way more to transfer it. They also allowed me to send btc to an email that wasn’t even associated with Coinbase so now my money is just somewhere in limbo and they will not do anything about it. On top of all this all their customer service is basically a robot that doesn’t not give a care or anything but generic messages. I wish I never put any money into these crooks what they’re doing should be illegal.

Easily gain a negative, lack of customer support assistance, worst software with little to none assistance. Bank verification is obsolete and bugged out, gdax is as bad as coinbase. Expect your funds to be put on hold due to their greediness to not respond to your information, not send a verification charge to your bank, and also make it so you can’t resend the verification, forcing you to go to gdax which wants a I.D verification that never works, same 2-4 week response time for customer service, and also the only response is from their automated robot chat that never knows anything more than 3 questions.

With the watching videos to earn crypto I felt like I clicked all the answers until I got it right… and the big thing I don’t like is the company spends too much money on advertising. If the company is the “best” place to buy and sell crypto it doesn’t need advertising to help it grow. I think they should infuse their money elsewhere and reinvest it into the company such as better customer support and adding crypto futures just for an example. Coinbase is a good starter for crypto I don’t see any major issues with them I recommend them to any of my friends just starting out.

I am only playing with 50 to 100 at a time…(1.49 purchase fee, charged me .38 cents when price shows 34 (lag), combined with spread 2.43… someone made 3.92 in half a second) so I am guessing that the less wealthy pay more for moving their money to often because they can’t afford to let small amounts sit. This is a big boy’s arena. Those of you who are struggling should stay out of this game.  Bring big money and think long term.

Payments are hard to manage, fees are plentiful and annoying, and the whole portfolio section was made with minimal usability or explanation. I didn't know I was paying directly from the bank and not the cash I had loaded it for a few days, and that's not something you run into in a well-planned app. The app and service are not what you want.

There is no way to contact coinbase customer support except through email, and when you eventually do get an email, they won’t respond again to a reply. In other words, you cannot have a conversation with a coinbase representative. You have to submit a request for them to email you and they will send you one email regarding the issue. If, for whatever reason, they did not answer your question/issue in its entirety (as with my case), the only way to get another response is to submit another request for them to email you. As you can imagine, this can impair your ability to trade and fundamentally destroys any trust you have with the exchange.

That being said I have had issues almost everywhere trying to update everything and making sure it was on the right one. Coinbase in particular has been the absolute worst in customer service I've experienced up to this point. Not only did they not provide a 2fa to verify but wouldn't provide an email, validate my drivers license, or even connect me with an agent or even a human being to correct the problem. All I got was redirected to the troubleshoot page and any number I called resulted in the same. If there was an ability to negatively rate an app this would be one of those occasions. I don't recommend using this app unless you intend to lose investments with absolutely no resolve from trying to verify your account. God forbid someone change their phone number lol."
coinbase,ios,HipCaneDad,1,2024-07-22 17:01:58,"Just had my assets scammed off Coinbase. Shame on me, TBF. But Coinbase itself was no help at all, and I blame them for their part in this.  Scammer persuaded me to transfer my Coinbase assets to Coinbase Wallet app.  What could go wrong, right? Got suspicious during scam, and reached out to Coinbase to verify if this was indeed their representative. You can’t reach Coinbase by phone, so I scrambled to try their Support Chat; which only gave canned answers, never answering my repeated question: is this your rep.? So my point is: if scammers work at the speed of a phone call, why can’t Coinbase respond in a timely way? Why don’t they have a “ help! Am I being scammed?” Hotline? Honestly took TWO DAYS trying to reach a Human representative. Of course by then funds were gone. And believe it or not, no one has reached out to me since. Seven years Crypto Journey on my favorite platform, and they let me down when I needed them."
coinbase,ios,RobCFA,5,2017-10-13 22:17:59,"If you are considering investing in digital assets, such as bitcoin, start with this App.  Many good things to like here: Very easy to  start, invest, and share.

Coinbase is run by Brian Armstrong with funding from Digital Currency Group, run by Barry Silbert.  This is important because it's a wallet and you need to trust your provider.

The app is linked to a more full featured website.  Very easy to buy, sell, and send coin to friends.  Also, has a Vault feature which is used to store larger balances more cryptographically secure through multi-signature access provides much needed  sleep at night comfort.

The company has a history of making sound announcements; especially when volume spikes and trading is impossible globally...and this does happen.

They were also leaders during the Ethereum split and most recently during the birth of bitcoin cash.  

If you are going to start in crypto (wise move, early days) start here, go slow, learn and grow your portfolio.

coinbase,ios,103847463737,4,2021-09-21 13:25:24,"Overall Coinbase is an excellent app for all things cryptocurrency.  It’s interface is appealing to the eye.  The rewards feature is a great idea and a major reason I continue to use this app.  While I enjoy this app there are a few things I would like added to make the user experience better.

1. There’s no filter options for the crypto that you earn. (Amount of shares owned, total value of shares, total return on investment)

2. No ability to see the total gain or loss of individual cryptocurrency. It’s very annoying to have to look at each one to see how much I’ve gained or lost by looking at the difference
Between the amount I spent and the value now.  I think that could be streamlined and it would benefit this app greatly.  I would like to see it almost copy Robinhoods design for their “Investing” Tab.

3. I found it very weird that I was unable to find a feedback section on any Coinbase app or the website.  The App Store reviews aren’t the most intuitive way to receive or give feedback. 

Other than these annoying issues Coinbase is great."
coinbase,ios,Cire Luey,3,2021-06-10 00:11:07,"I’ve been using Coinbase for the past 6 months, and recently I’ve experienced some issues that are rather annoying. Though they’re not gamebreaking, I’m leaving a review in hopes that these hiccups will be addressed.

I had to sign in earlier this week, which was odd to me because after making my account initially I’ve never had to sign in. I’m talking full sign in, not enter my PIN or use FACE ID—however, speaking of entering a PIN and FACE ID, I’m noticing now that when I boot up the app I’m prompted to enter my PIN, even though I have my settings to use my FACE ID instead. This features works when I switch back to Coinbase from another app, but it doesn’t work if I’m opening the app. That was never an issue prior to this week.

Please look into these bugs."
coinbase,ios,Easy E3,1,2019-04-07 05:34:12,"Firstly, as all have mentioned, the constant fees eat up your gains. Also I’m convinced they are siphoning feed on the “free” trades also, since after numerous trades my value would always decrease by ~$5 per transaction regardless of the direction either crypto was moving.

Now for the REALLY ugly: They blocked my trades when I tried to move to a different currency near the apex of a 2x surge. Ive also had it happen on smaller rising trends as well. Guess what...they ALSO blocked my trades on the down slope. So I was forced to ride it up and then back down, to 25% below what I started with.

Feels scammy. I’m going to cash out before they take all of my capital. All in all, after gaining about 20% on my capital in a few days, all but 1% which I get to keep is going to them due to fees. That’s right, 95% of all the headway I made watching and trading for hours went into their pockets and I was LUCKY to fold when I had an additional 1% to walk away with."
coinbase,ios,Trettykb,2,2021-10-18 23:39:57,"I’ve used their app since 2015. The wallet is decent. Sometimes you get locked out of your account and it will take 72+ hours to get back in. You learn to get through it.

The debit/credit card though… Do not get one of these. I had a good chunk of money stolen. After 15 calls with the customer support team over a 3 month period, each time the service rep would state that I should have a response soon, I started emailing them and had to restart the process all over. Then it was 3 weeks of frustrating emailing still without any light of day!  

One of the biggest wastes of time I’ve ever experienced. I encourage you to avoid the credit card as they do not have the resources, training, or systems in place to handle if/when your card number gets stolen."
coinbase,ios,Creat3 nicknam3,1,2024-12-12 01:39:47,"Coinbase was great at first. I made a lot of money within a week of the downloading the app however there is no technical support even if you are Coinbase one subscripted you still are not able to receive any type of technical support phone support or chat support. If you do get someone on the line, they don’t have any knowledge on how to help you nor that they have access to a supervisor for you to. I started my account on November 10 made a profit of $1000. My account was immediately restricted when I provided government issued ID that was rejected, and when I spoke with customer service after four days of trying to contact them, they told me that my account was denied reinstatement based on the response I gave a survey, which was that I wanted to invest and learn crypto so they did not my account based on that answer. I see a class action lawsuit coming very soon."
coinbase,ios,KoowanPStark,1,2022-12-11 18:29:25,"BEWARE, this app is extremely user-unfriendly and you could lose a LOT of money if you don’t know exactly what you are doing. This app is NOT for beginners. The various menu screens often lead to dead ends that require you to take an action without telling you how or where to perform that action. The help menu is outdated and often simply wrong. More than once it gives the wrong instructions. The app is an enormous, non-ergonomic mess. You should already have experience with crypto trading BEFORE you use this or it could cost you. Other weird bugs crop up as well such as the app will suddenly change the brightness settings of your phone. One minute it’s blinding bright, next screen is unreadably dark. This isn’t just the app. If you go to your phone settings you’ll find the brightness has been altered device-wide. Weird."
coinbase,ios,Local Public Adjuster,1,2022-09-21 10:50:19,"Do not use the Coinbase debit card you will not have protection from fraud. I used my card while I was out of the country in May 2022, I was a victim of a ATM skimmer. I provided all the details to Coinbase fraud department 3 different times, providing proof of the transactions and that one transaction was attempted while I was on the plane coming home and another while I was back in the states. However, it’s been 120 days and I can’t get a response or any proper communication from Coinbase. When I call I’m told that department only respond by email, and that they will respond and resolve your claim in 60 days, it’s been 120 days and no response. So before you decide to use their card, think twice because you don’t have any protection from fraudulent transactions. It’s crazy that a multi-billion dollar company can’t protect its customers, oh and the claim is only for $500."

My money is just sitting in my account and I can’t even withdraw it to my bank account! Absolutely ridiculous and useless customer support.

Edit: Reached out the Coinbase support after receiving a response from them on the App Store and they STILL have done nothing to help. They claimed my case was being reviewed, but my case was closed over a month despite not getting resolved. The customer service representative did not seem knowledgeable at all. If you want a company that allows it’s customer service representatives to keep you running in circles without resolving your requests, then Coinbase is definitely it! I would NOT recommend trusting them with your time or money."
coinbase,ios,6288439,1,2021-12-14 08:25:25,"Other exchanges might be more complicated, but 99% of them are better and more informative than Coinbase. Most of the time, if a big price fluctuation happens you have no real time data to decide what the best play is. It’s almost like they hide the big market fluctuations by not letting you see them until they have dipped significantly. You can get real time price data on so many other platforms but for some reason the exchange with the biggest name and some of the craziest fees on the average consumer can’t provide that? I’ve never written an app review in my life, but I think it’s essential to let people know that there are so many better options. The way I see Coinbase is that it might be helpful to a novice in the crypto space, but realistically it’s one of the worst options. Do yourself a favor and pick another one chief."
coinbase,ios,youngpedro344,5,2021-04-14 16:26:25,App is really good learned a lot about crypto at a fast rate and my accounts already up to $55 by just investing 10 and watching their videos They paid me $36 just to learn about crypto which gave me a advantage over the market. Only thing I can say that I wish was added is the ability to trade crypto with currency’s not supported but shown on crypto some that are under a dollar a stock are usually unavailable. Great way to start investing in yourself though my strategy is to invest for the long run with currency’s worth less than a dollar and over a few years maybe a few will blow just like Bitcoin due to all the new use in technology
coinbase,ios,Gobbler87,1,2021-05-14 14:24:33,"The app is very user friendly and of course coinbase charges their fee for any purchases. However the reason I’m giving this app a 1 star is because of the deceptive tactics coinbase uses in trading. When you go to trade from one coin to another the preview before completion shows that there is $0 coinbase charge for trading. However I’ve noticed that everyone I trade the amount trading over is $3 less that what it told me was being traded. So I’ve I went to trade $100 of Bitcoin for something else I would only receive $97 of the other coin. And this has happen on EVERY one of them. 
Very dishonest to show that they are charging $0 when they are really scraping $3 off the top every time. 
Now I get it that not a lot of money however when I’m making small $100 trades that’s 3% of my money. Plus no matter how much it is the dishonesty behind it is what warrants the negative review."

Change plus a 1 dollar fee. Oh there was a 1 dollar fee for trans 100 bucks also. I got a note that said my LTC will appear in my wallet in 8 days also. Need to track fees cause it dose t show up after you enter. Maybe on the day of transaction? Very new to this and I've read the good and the bad reviews for this app. It dose seem easier than others I've looked at. Time will tell. I will update once this trade goes thru.

coinbase,ios,Leo_chavez,1,2018-01-06 08:45:53,DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!!! DO NOT INVEST WITH COINBASE. I downloaded it because I wanted to buy Ripple and in order to do that I had to make those transfers from Coinbase but I should have kept looking. Coinbase has taken so much money from me in fees it's insane. In order to link my credit card I had to verify it and they charged me three times for the verification all charges were above $1 and they're no returning that money. I've heard of companies sending you money to verify but never taking away from your bank to verify. Another thing that's extremely upsetting is the fact that these idiots don't even have my bank so I can transfer my money back to my bank!? They don't have America first or Mount of America? So now I can't even transfer the money I have in my wallet to my account. They have fees to buy a crypto currency and a fee to transfer to wallet and another to transfer to bank!? These guys should not be 4 1/2 stars no way.
coinbase,ios,eusheen,1,2017-12-13 10:33:55,"My account was closed for what seemed to be no apparent reason and I was forced to send my Bitcoin and Etherium to a new wallet. Later that day I received an email that said:     
“Upon careful review, we believe your account has engaged in prohibited use in violation of our Terms of Service and we regret to inform you that we can no longer provide you with access to our service. We respectfully request that you follow the on-screen instructions presented when you log into your Coinbase account to send any remaining balance offsite to an external address.”
  No explanation was given as to the specifics...
    The Coinbase network is unstable!  buy transactions take up to two weeks and 6 days to sell! This combined with the fees make this app a no go for me ever again.  
   the only thing good I can say is I’m glad that this got me into crypto currency. Other than that it was an over all thumbs down experience.

Update: If you take the time to look through the reviews something strange is happening. There are lots of 5 star reviews that are actually negative reviews. So either they (the reviewers) forgot to put the right star rating that actually reflects their reviews or someone is Messing with the ratings... I would be will to bet the average rating of this app is much lower if it was properly rated!"

I had 3 unauthorized transactions on my bank statement that Coinbase took out ($395). It did not go to my Coinbase account, and apparently Coinbase doesn’t know where it went either. I have been in contact with support for over a month in which I have called over 10 times (never once received contact from them first). Every time I called support I spoke with someone I could barely understand and even with a case number, nobody knew what was going on or if there was an update. As of today they say there is nothing they can do because they don’t know where the money went. I told my bank and luckily they reimbursed me instantly, already doing way more than Coinbase did in a month. Stay far away from this scamming app."

The two step verification with my old number that I’ve updated countless and the app will tell me I already have that number updated! After today I’m done I will not be investing with Coinbase when the account locks you out from your money at critical buy or sell points. Have a good one Coinbase I will be withdrawing my investments and using another platform! I suggest serious investors do the same this app will cause you to lose some serious money!"

This morning I had some great gains on my investment and tried to sell as prices were dropping. When I sold I received a notification that it went through so I’m waiting to see usd in my wallet. Nothing showed for about 5 minutes and when it finally did it was my shares I had just tried to sell. However now the price had dropped 15%. Infuriated I quickly tried to sell again when a notification read “due to suspicious market activity coinbase has disabled transactions” no later than 5 minutes went by and it worked just fine but now I had lost 30%. I won’t name the crypto but it is supported and sold on coinbase. So you’re telling me when a stock goes up 50% in 24 hours you halt transactions?! Are you kidding me coinbase? Thanks for screwing me.
coinbase,ios,BrandonSpangler,3,2021-09-05 14:39:16,"I really like the user interface of the Coinbase app. It’s easy to use even for novices. My biggest complaint with this Coinbase is that there is no way to view our Profit/Losses and no way to view the average price paid per coin. This seems like a very much needed feature for a crypto exchange where the goal is to make profit. If this very basic feature was on this app I would give it five stars (and willing to change my review if corrected). Like any app from time to time it crashes but that’s pretty normal under high traffic times. Again, easy to use app that shows what coins are moving and has a “Coinbase Earn” feature where you can earn small amounts of crypto while watching short videos on a specific coin."

Without having to double or triple click into the site. Right now if you want to look at your portfolio, there is a list of all the other crypto that you don’t own and of the crypto that you do, it lists the total stock price rather than how much money you have earned with the amount of crypto you have on hand. I want to double click into other cryptos and features in other places, but I also want a clear portfolio that lists exactly what my money is doing in this sphere."
coinbase,ios,Philosopherwarrior,5,2024-01-19 06:10:19,"I’m updating a review that I wrote the years ago, since Coinbase has made it a point to implement better practices.

1. CB has an optional monthly fee that waives individual transaction fees. This is excellent for investors like me.

2. They finally added in “average cost” feature, something that was absent for a ridiculously long time. This helps you track how much you have spent on a coin, and determine where the profit line is. However, this featured does not seem very accurate. Robinhood has the sharpest average cost feature I’ve seen.

3. Coinbase is extremely judicious with the coins they offer. They have high standards and I trust the coins they list. They have delisted coins when their teams don’t meet a standard. I have a lot of faith in CB for this reason.

4. It is finally very clear how to suspend automatic buys. Initially, they made it very easy to set it up, but very hard to discontinue. It is now as easy to suspend as it is to set it up.

5. The wallet feature lets you buy coins that are not available on CB or other platforms."

I have followed every step and been very compliant with support but they keep repeatedly emailing me the same things and requesting the same information over and over. I have asked complex questions only to receive the exact same response as a previous email.

Update: the developer is asking me to reach out but that’s the exact same problem. You only get canned replies and nobody is looking into your account. I have even sent them proof from THEIR system that my account is fully verified and yet they don’t take the time to look into the issue. How can the developer comment on a review and asking us to reach out to them if they never take it serious.

My buys and sending of crypto have been disabled for a year and a half now and every time I contact customer support they tell me the case is being reviewed and no further information can be given at this time. Then the case will close a few days later with no explanation. This has probably happened 10 times by now. Zero explanation, zero help. Im at a loss as to what to do. Very disappointing from a customers point of view and kind of scary from a investors point of view. I’ve been buying all of my crypto from other avenues. Overall worst customer service experience I’ve ever encountered & I sense the same out of the customer service reps, they’re hands are simply tied and powerless. 😩"
coinbase,ios,Annoyedbycoinbase,1,2022-01-23 00:15:47,"For some time now there has been an annoying pop up when you use the app blocking access to your account and will keep logging you out when you refuse to answer two idiotic questions. First question- how much crypto do you expect to trade per year? Second question - what industry do you work in? And they claim “Coinbase is required to collect this information “ I would like to know - By whom! I want to know which department of US government is asking these question.
Update.
Response from Coinbase…. “We’d like to work with you on this. Please feel free to contact us”
I DON’T WANT TO CONTACT YOU!
It is really easy - Stop harassing your clients with annoying lies that you are required to know what business they are in and how much money they may invest. Stop making your clients’ access to their accounts difficult and stop  threatening us with disabling our accounts if we don’t provide that information. These questions have nothing to do with verification of anyone’s identity. Or post the department’s name and the request that you have received ordering you to ask these questions.
If you want to be considered a respectable financial institution than act like one; follow the laws and regulations (not an idiot from a marketing department)"
coinbase,ios,Jeremy Crockett,1,2021-05-12 16:23:49,"I signed up for Coinbase like 1-month ago. I thought it was great at first, I was getting free crypto and learning about crypto. Then came the headaches. My portfolio balance (which by all standards should be the total of all my assets on Coinbase) never matched my actual total of my assets. I emailed support and all they did was send condescending information like the value of your assets fluctuate with financial markets. Like duh!!! That’s not what I was asking about. My total assets percentage wise only added up to 87%. There was a 13% difference between my balance and my actual total assets. I withdrew all my assets from Coinbase (meaning I have 0 value on Coinbase) yet my portfolio balance shows $38. I wouldn’t trust a financial app that cannot even total assets correctly with thousands of dollars especially one that has such terrible customer service. 0 stars if possible."
coinbase,ios,JaXzing,2,2021-02-03 01:15:36,I don’t mean to judge but this app is supposed to be the premier safest and most secure way to really have anything to do with cryptocurrency. That being said the customer service robot and account customer service infinite lockout loop is especially a treat. Now let us look at the way the mobile tabs are presented. If I trade coins I can’t see the dollar amount of the previous coins in the history so I can’t tell if I gained. I don’t like how the timing is updated and I really don’t like the amount of data and information is collected and used. I say it’s shady because it acts that way I don’t care to prove anything but every trade seems scalped to loose instantly and although I am very happy with my investments and grateful for the rewards but could go without the buts this is the only app I use and have been burned on coins that are no longer supported or tradable.

They told me I can cash my funds out and buy crypto else where, but to do that I would incur fees, some losses, and taxes. So for the time being they have locked my cash and funds into their own exchange for unknown reasons that they “cannot disclose.” I would use another platform if you could that does not hold users funds hostage.

They don’t have the support for this yet which shows how little they care about the customer. All they do is maximize profit and do not care for you average customer. There are better platform out there. Even there customer support team is very untrained and unwilling to escalate to a team of expert for review. We are talking about hundreds and thousands of dollars here. They think this is toy. Platform like these should be banned. And average person can’t be bothered to litigate situations like this. So they take the beating.

Coinbase has been an excellent platform for managing my cryptocurrency investments. The interface is user-friendly, making it easy to buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrencies even for beginners. Security is top-notch, and I feel confident knowing my assets are well-protected. The app is fast, reliable, and offers great features like real-time price tracking and educational resources to stay informed. Customer support has been responsive and helpful whenever I’ve had questions.

iOS app is not UX optimized. Portfolio does not reflect actual investments, it includes all currencies that user never invested in. user can’t sort that list to relevant or recent, redundant with watchlist. As a result, the currencies I invested in are far below the fold, lost in the mix of the many currencies I never invested in. I have to scroll down a lot of currencies to find the ones I purchased, why isn’t portfolio tab more reflective of my actual portfolio / transactions history. Why can’t I edit/sort that list? Why do you show me currencies I don’t care about in my portfolio instead of the transaction history? Why are my investments hidden below the fold?

Why is the available balance missing in the purchase flow? 

Why can’t I sell cryptos to desired fiat currency? Why do you let change my currency settings to Euros but that the Sell flow remains is in USD?

All these questions show that you need better UX team. It’s cool to make designs look visually kid-friendly but it becomes useless and decorative when the app fails to deliver consistency and basic MVP features."

Plus all that I’ve earned with the Learn & Earn is like nothing is left in return and it makes no sense.  Yes you all pay to try newer coins but afterwards it is all gone.

coinbase,ios,*FORTUNE*,1,2023-12-31 05:10:02,"This used to be a really great app years ago. Slowly it started getting worse and more expensive to do simple things. One example, I went to send Bitcoin (which now cost an outrageous amount, in my case it was 23%of what I was sending). They took the payment fee from the amount I was sending, so who I was sending it to didn’t get the right amount of money. Which makes me have to pay another outrageous fee to send them the rest of the money. I tried to cancel the pending transaction, but their instructions on how to do so are incorrect. When I went to get a live agent to help, it told me I had a 41 minute wait. By then the transaction went through, to be honest, I probably the lost money because of this app. Not a good app, support is virtually non-existent (unless an automation robot helps..) and is unjustifiably expensive."

You typically spend 1-5$ per transaction depending on how much you buy, however that may not seem like a lot but over time (like with their Recurring Purchases) you end up paying more than you'd like to.

coinbase,ios,SoupSoldier,3,2021-02-07 14:02:02,"Pros: 
1). I like the simple charting interface to watch your portfolio grow. 
2). Offers a good amount of cryptocurrencies to buy.
3). Earn free crypto for learning about different cryptocurrencies. 
4). Instant buying power while funds settle. 

Cons:
1). The simple charting interface becomes WAY to simple! It would be nice to have pie charts or other graphs to track the growth of my investments next to my purchases. 
2). You can only place market orders, no limit orders. 
3). Zero charting besides a dull line graph. No candles, drawing, or any other tools. 
4). No crypto news section. 
5). Overall just too simple. 

To offset some of these cons I downloaded Coinbase Pro and moved all my funds over there. This was to be a mistake. It was overly complicated to move the funds and once they hit CBP, all my buying history was gone. Example: let’s say I had eight purchases of BTC of $25 each. Once transferred into CBP all of those instances became one deposit $200, which stinks. With CBP you get basic order book info and simple candle graphs but you lose all ability to track or chart your investments; ALL! Oddly enough the Pro version is even more plain GUI.

coinbase,ios,"Paul, CTA",2,2022-04-14 18:09:24,"Seriously flawed. I’m writing sideways.  It is hard to believe the founder of Coinbase, who’s suppose to be supremely tech savvy, would have such an antiquated app and interface. I’m typing sideways. The app was written for first generation smart phones, and the screen looks like such. It remains locked in a bulky, truncated portrait mode. You may not orient your device horizontally.   

The graphs are by far the worst I’ve ever seen. There are zero units of measurement, neither on the vertical scale, nor the horizontal. Thus you can not visually gauge price vs. time.  You must go to another app to view graphs. 

That being said, the app is superb for educating neophytes on what’s out there, an excellent educational tool. 

One of the most egregious flaws is that you can’t read the transaction at the bottom of the screen because it’s blocked with a thick, opaque huge horizontal blue bar that says “TRADE”.  You cannot decline it, minimize it, or make it go away.  It completely covers your first trade, and you simply cannot view the transaction.  A can of bug spray should come with this app.

It’s great for executing a transaction, 
but really poor quality for a crypto app.

coinbase,ios,SandrasLibrary,4,2017-12-27 07:21:06,"December 2017 – update

With the cryptocraze boom over the last year, I’ve noticed a marked change with Coinbase, unfortunately not for the better. Fees are ridiiiiiculously high when sending my BTC to another address, and it takes longer for transactions to go through. 

It’s not uncommon for the app to crash/not load/disable buys/sells during high traffic days when there’s a lot of movement in the market, which makes for a frustrating experience. 

January 2017 – original review

Coinbase has come a long way since early 2014. After buying BTC and sending it to my old Hive wallet, and pretty much forgetting about it the past 3 years, I was alarmed to find out my old Hive wallet was no longer a thing (I don't recall keeping BTC in the same place where you bought them being proper back then). But now Coinbase is one of the most respected 1-stop shops for managing BTC. It took about 15min longer than the stated 30 for my BTC transfer to be confirmed, but the app is simple and beautiful to work with. Love the price alerts I can set up—just a really attractive and functional interface. Well done!"

I have tried many many times.  Either it gives me a protocol error, a server too busy error, or it successfully uploads and tells me that it's usually approved within 3-5 minutes.  Well... it's never approved for me.  It eventually seems to timeout... and revert back to the beginning and wants me to upload ID again.  I'm so over this.

coinbase,ios,DarkZen77,1,2024-02-21 16:15:09,"For new investors in cryptocurrency, be aware that this app is not user-friendly. It does not walk you through anything, and it does not inform you of the fact that any funds you place in your wallet will be held for at least seven days before it can be utilized offsite. This may be something that is apparent to experienced crypto investors, but it is not something that would be assumed by newbies such as myself. So if your intention is to purchase presale coins, you would be much better served to utilize your debit or credit card as opposed to the Coinbase app. Also, their customer service is either unwilling or unable to rectify mistakes made based upon false information provided by their own agents. I will not go into detail, but I am in the process of filing a formal complaint with the Better Business Bureau and contacting my lawyer about possible legal action."
coinbase,ios,bringbacktruth,2,2022-12-09 15:36:40,"Started out okay but the fees have grown alot and they keep upping the fees as well. I staked ETH and I wasn’t supposed to be able to get that back till the staking was over, now they are changing the rules and taking a “percentage” of whatever I have or had staked. Its like a bait and switch tactic. Sell you on making a percentage return ,which has fluctuated the whole time, and then after a year plus of it being staked and loosing money on it and its just about leveled out they(coinbase) tell me they are taking more of my money for protection. Sounds like a bad mob movie and whats worse i’m part of it. You get a fee assessment for selling stock, then another fee for transferring that amount sold to your bank. So your assessed a fee twice on the same money which dwindles a little each time"

Conversion are easy and has a wallet app you can link. FEES are high, (but relative reasonable and cheap compared les to others) though, even their Pro version has lower fees. Be nice to see fees (lower). Overall though is a good simple easy to use app to start off your crypto experience and learning (updated to reasonable state the fees are reasonable as I think my previous review sounded as fees were overly high, they are cheaper compared to others and for the service they provide I find them reasonable)."
coinbase,ios,APPALLED & DISAPOINTED,5,2020-08-13 19:09:22,I have been using Coinbase for about a year and the app works well until you need customer service.  I usually access my account through my phone and my phone auto fills my password. Recently I was asked to complete the 2 point ID and now I’m LOCKED OUT! I have emailed them several times and the just ask has your problem been resolved. I replied NO. The I get another email asking has your problem been resolved. I have a significant amount of money invested with there app and they are not providing ANY  assistance. I’m outraged. I would never recommend there app.

Tech support said there was nothing they could do at this time like we’re in the middle of a bull market what??????. Terrified to even make a purchase on the browser side cause it keeps forcing me to captcha over and over again. I must say I’ve had no issues with Kraken. I want to use this app but how can I when there support. 

In the help section on their support page there isn’t even an option to ask questions outside of their highly funneled guidelines. I don’t understand how this company functions. Fix your iOS app it doesn’t work and hire some actual people to support your customers unbelievable in 2021!!! This is supposed to replace banks how????"
coinbase,ios,pieman3020,3,2021-05-13 03:16:57,"I quite like the app, it’s easy to use and works great. But it could use some improvements, mainly when viewing your portfolio it should show the net percentage gain/loss for the hour, day, month, etc. and also how much you’re up or down in each coin per day. 

My biggest problem with Coinbase is the prices are always higher than the current market price so you don’t quite get as much as you could if you were to just buy a coin somewhere else. On top of that, the fees can get quite annoying. If you want to do anything it’s a 1%-5% fee depending on the payment method. I get they have to change a fee to stay running but it’s just really annoying"

As for the coin options, this platform has many to choose from (more than robinhood), but less than Binance.  Also, note that this app doesn’t support many current hot assets (ex dogecoin).  However, I still prefer this app the most considering the coin conversion ability, which is something I never would have thought would be valuable, and the safety/ security of the app."

Though I have contacted Coinbase customer support 5 times, there’s been zero response — not even a response to confirm that my support ticket was received. I can’t even call them to ask what is going on with my account. I even reached out to them on Instagram direct message — no response there either.

I was actually willing to invest in Bitcoin but not if I can’t transfer it back to my bank! I’ve been wanting help and guess what?? The Coinbase website has too much requests of complaints that you can’t that you can’t do crap about it! They should either get SUED or make it possible to transfer Coinbase money to the bank with the RIGHT amount of money!!! I’m never investing in Coinbase ever again. If I were to invest in Bitcoin, I would use cash app (WAY BETTER) because whatever you sell you can get it all back in your bank without so many complications!

Even more concerning is the fact that they fraudulently claim $0 fees for transfers across wallets or transfers from one crypto to another. Lies! They flat out show $0.00 fee on the page, but then skim funds off the top of every deal - they stole $24 from me using this deceptive and dishonest process on a less than $450 transaction! Insane!!

Only reason I’d bounce around was due to the fees being a little high but once i seen what I was getting with a little higher of a fee I just took quality over quantity and I’m not switching now.  Plus I always figured those competitions were fake but I actually won one of them recently and it was at a time that I really needed it to happen.

Recently they decided that staking needs to be hidden from Coinbase Advanced users so you need to toggle over to the basic version each time to access your staked coins. I also learned, after an hour going through the articles pushed by their AI chatbot and live reps instead of actually trying to understand and answer the question, that you cannot find out which coins can be staked on coinbase from this app unless you already own them. You can only lookup other coins from your desktop browser. Overall the app is adequate for now. We’ll see how long it lasts until they update it to death with useless and unnecessary changes."

Signing up and getting accustomed to crypto trading seemed to be a breeze for me.

Hi Jeremy,

After taking a look at your account, we see that you're not eligible to purchase cryptocurrency or deposit fiat using your linked payment methods. You may also have difficulty linking a new payment method.

There are a number of factors that affect purchase and deposit eligibility, and we're not able to provide specific details regarding our security processes or account reviews.

We've transferred your case to our team of specialists to look into this further and determine your account eligibility. We know this isn't the ideal experience, but we will contact you as soon as we can. We're currently experiencing a high number of requests and our responses may take longer than usual."

coinbase,ios,loljnbv,1,2021-02-22 20:29:05,"Please be careful for anyone that’s newly investing. They claim that their conversions from one asset to another is free. But what you don’t see and what they don’t tell you is that when you convert out of (let’s say ethereum and it’s currently trading at $1500) they will undervalue that asset and sell it out at $1400. Then the coin you want to convert it in to will be overvalued (let’s say Chainlink is currently at $30, they buy in at $33) they will then buy you into your conversion coin way over the value it is currently trading. Did this with BNT, I had $1540 sitting in USDC, I went to convert that in to BNT for its current price of $5.96 and it bought me in at a price of $6.90 almost a dollar higher than its current value. So my total value in my pickup was $1230.. a $210 difference between the conversions.. take your coins somewhere else and convert. Coinbase is feeding off your limbs and making you think that conversions are harmless."
coinbase,ios,TW PAPER READER,5,2017-11-07 20:50:21,"I have been a user of the Coinbase platform since it’s inception. Coinbase is, hands down, the easiest and most intuitive way to buy, hold and sell cryptocurrencies. If you are looking to trade, use Coinbase’s GDAX platform. Coinbase makes setting up an account extremely easy and you are able to attach your bank account and credit/debit cards as well. Coinbase also take security extremely seriously, and holds the majority of cryptos in cold storage. They are also the only platform of which I am aware, that insure’s your holdings. I recommend Nunnally setting up a password to open the Coinbase app but also using two factor authentication."
coinbase,ios,NicolasG93,1,2018-04-17 23:06:06,"***Note to all users: AVOID transferring money between digital wallets within Coinbase, it is a trap and your money will end up “in the cloud” as customer service liked to call it.

First off I’d like to say that coin base is an excellent platform for beginners that would like to invest their money into digital Currencies. Simple, easy to use and the customer service is friendly:)

With that being said, the reason for the 1star review is because I lost a fair amount of money for transferring funds from my litecoin digital wallet to my bitcoin digital wallet.

HERE’S ALL I DID: Using the url given to my account SPECIFICALLY for my bitcoin digital wallet, I sent money from my litecoin wallet to that address. Few moments later, the transaction status said complete... Although there was no money that ended up in my bitcoin wallet, but of course the money was taken from my litecoin wallet.

I spoke with customer service and her explanation for what happened was that the money just ended up in the cloud and that there was nothing I could do, the money was lost.

So pretty much that method of transferring funds is a trap to take your money with no reimbursement. 

I hope this advice gets to you guys well, as I’d like to prevent this trickery from happening to anyone else."

While both having useful but completely separate information and fees depending on if you’re using advanced or basic, even if you have coinebase one and premium you’ll still get hit with a fee when doing limit orders on advanced but when you do limit orders on basic with one of these subscriptions you don’t get charged a fee it’s very confusing and not convenient."

I believe Coinbase will remain the industry leader as we see more institutional investors entering the market. Not to mention the new Base network, which will make investing more affordable due to lower fees and make onboarding easier for new investors. 
Decentralized exchanges have yet to develop the necessary ramp infrastructure to facilitate even flow transactions with Trad-fi networks…and until then Coinbase remains one of the limited secure options for moving in and between the fiat grid."

On top of that when you purchase a stock for let’s say $10 (this if your 1st stock you buy , you don’t have any others) the average will be a lot more like $15 so it will take even longer to make money .

The system has my home country as Spain and despite my many attempts to send my US Passport and State ID, the system will not accept it—even noting that the IDs are valid but don’t match my home country. This is frustrating because I can only link a European bank account to the app and because I don’t have one, my bitcoin is trapped. What complicates things more is that they require a utility bill and another piece of ID to verify my country, however I am a student and don’t have any of these things in my name.

coinbase,ios,Jsjdjfjdjjejdjxj,1,2024-11-22 20:16:56,"I first used coinbase back in 2016. Prior to becoming a publicly traded company they were pretty good, but still had issues. After becoming a public company the customer experience plummeted and the company seems corrupt (big surprise). It start in 2017 when an IRS audit was launched on myself and thousands of other early Bitcoin investors; coinbase falsely reported our total trade volume (buys + sales) as earnings. Clearly earnings is (sells - buys). As this is such an amateur mistake, I am certain this was done intentionally to force early adopters to fork over information to the government. The audit lasted 5 years and was excruciating. It ended with me paying significantly more than what I actually profited. 
Today, coinbase still has many issues which I am sure are intentional by design as they have existed for years now, including:
Difficulties linking bank accounts.
Difficulties depositing.
Delays in withdrawals.
System failure.
And generally making it difficult or impossible to buy or sell at critical times like market highs, or during buying opportunities after news has been released.
AVOID. There are many other non-public companies that offer a better service and won’t falsely report your earnings."

There’s one problem, my thumb is blocking the view of what where I’m guiding the dotted line so I can’t tell if I’m at the dip. The only way to kind of tell is by looking at the value on the top left corner but it’s kind of hard to tell even then because the graph is so sensitive to even the slightest movement. 

Can you guys make it so that we’re able to peek at where the dotted line is exactly without having to move our finger up or down? Every time I slide my finger up or down to see where the dotted line is lined up, the dotted line disappears and the value also disappears."
coinbase,ios,$Jgarrison66,1,2023-09-06 20:11:41,"Over a year ago I stopped using this app after they did some shady stuff. Can’t remember the exact situation but over $200 was taken from me by them. I sold $200 usdc and went to withdraw. They tried saying I owed them for nothing. At best what they went off was a glitch in their system (common with Coinbase) and after all this time I logged back in today and saw they took that money from my bank acct back in April. At the time of the initial issue I filed a complaint with the SEC or whoever regulates them. Never heard back on anything and I now see they took the money without permission. I will never do business with them again. Other smaller issues like that had happened before but it was never that much, always a small dollar amount that I wouldn’t notice. Yes funds just disappeared before this."
coinbase,ios,j-say,1,2022-10-16 19:50:10,"I’ve been a big supporter of Coinbase for a while but this last update has been so frustrating. I always want to transfer from Coinbase to ledger but this update removed my trade history under each coin and the only way to transfer is on home page, requiring me to look up the address every time since I can’t see my trade history easily anymore. How hard is it to have a send to last receiver option for people who transfer to ledgers often?

Also, the most ANNOYING thing is with EVERY transfer it says there’s security worries and I have to verify who I am or wait 3 days. So, I do it over and over and over. Once for EVERY transfer.

I’ve called them multiple times with no help at all but makes it worse is I’m a paid Coinbase one customer who is supposed to get “customer service”. But it turns out it means outsourced script readers that really can’t help. No tech people available to talk to and no managers. 

I understand trying to save some money, but customer service is NOT an area to save money. I feel very unsafe now and I never did before. Coinbase will not stay on top if they don’t reverse their customer service approach asap. 

Considering switching to Gemini."

This is a terrible app, do not use this app there’s been multiple times where communication has been hard and if I could choose not to use this app I would. But I have too and this hasn’t been easy for me. Tell me why I should still have to KEEP ON VERIFYING WHEN I HAD SUCCESSFUL VERIFICATION 6 TIMES. This app is awful so awful, I hope this verification isn’t as bad for the others on this app. I talked to support and guess what they said. “We cannot verify on the app” THEN WHY IS IT AN OPTION TO VERIFY ON THE APP??? This has been the most complicated situations I’ve been. They need to fix there app to not verify on there because obviously they don’t allow it."

When it was apparent they are the only ones to Fix the problem they refused, and even said “you should have sent a smaller amount to see if it would work”. It should of worked it their coin! This same issue has happened to multiple people and all of them have said that Coinbase eventually helped them out to fix it, they just don’t want to do they will putz around!

I would also wish for is more choices on widgets other than crypto graphs to follow on widgets. I would like a account balance of your portfolio you can set on widgets without opening and logging into the app. Like webull, fidelity, robinhood, and acorns does."

I put my debit card and my banking information as requested to only find out later that they withdrew 5 other deposits that I did not authorize. I had already loaded the card once so now they have six deposits but only one shows up on the app. They locked my account and said that I owed them money to unlock my account. I have been in touch via email for the past two days for them to refund my money and close my account. I sent them a copy of what was taken out via email and to no avail no refund as of yet. Of course I am goi g through my bank to recover all my money back I am also going to take action. DELETEING THIS APP ONCE I GET MY MONEY BACK.

Has a bunch of intro videos that incentivize learning more about the blockchain and all supporting technology use that have popped up and established themselves as applicable and creative to the far reach of Bitcoin and other crypto currencies. With more knowledge of how it all works it feels a lot better investing in them and then understanding how, if we all stay informed and involved in the entire process and grow with the technology, this technology can help liberate us from human suppressors and old systems of oppression. The monetary system being the number one culprit of this."

Thankfully, I haven’t experienced any issues ever while using the app. Never had a transaction flagged or failed. I think a lot of problems people run into is when they are messing around on 3rd party sites that are blacklisted. Lots of bad actors in crypto, so these exchanges set up security checks to prevent illegal activity. As long as you are trading crypto legitimately, and not using weird crypto sites like gambling sites, you will be 100% fine. It’s a fantastic exchange with lots of protection!"
coinbase,ios,napfourteen,1,2021-02-28 04:06:10,"I’ve really enjoyed using Coinbase despite a few hiccups they have had here and there, however the latest update just really degraded the quality of the app and I don’t even like looking at it anymore. 

The new chart graphics look stupid. I quite liked the old ones. The new charts are probably the worst charts I have ever seen anywhere, ever. Plus, I’m pretty sure they are not even accurate and up to date now. The percentage change no longer represents the actual price movement and could now say up when the price is actually down.

The market up/down percentage no longer works. The market will be down on everything and it says the market is up, or visa-versa. 

Oh and I just noticed that if you go to the top gainers list it doesn’t list the gainers in order, and actually also sprinkles losers in with the gainers. Basically the top gainers list is now just a bunch of random coins that could be either up or down. 

This has really just become an absolutely dumb app to interact with or even have to look at.

I used to enjoy the home screens graphical summaries of the charts for projects on my watch list, ah and you got rid of those too.

shame, shame on the developers and executives for rolling out this trash"
coinbase,ios,Finance Senior,1,2019-12-07 17:57:32,"It has been a couple years since my experience with coinbase, however I whole-heartedly believe this company is run by thieves. Long story short, I started with coinbase a few years ago. After buying a few coins and investing a decent amount of money, they locked my account because all of a sudden coinbase isn’t supported in the state my ID was issued, even though I provided the necessary paperwork stating I wasn’t living in that state at the time.

After numerous phone calls, spending 30+ hours on the phone to fix this issue, my account was locked for over 3 months with all my money locked into coinbase. If I had enough time to write out the nature of my conversations with coinbase, I would and I completely regret not phone recording my conversations to prove this company is ran by thieves.

Started at 3:15 and it’s now 8:10. Problem is still not answered and I’m on the 4th representative after 3 of them ended the chat without answering the question. They can’t really talk to you because they have a page where they have to copy and paste sentences to use to answer whatever you say. Is it really that hard to get in contact that can give me an answer? I feel like if someone actually knew what they were doing and could freely talk, this is the type of question where it should take 5-8 minutes to answer not 5 hours. The app works, I’ll give it that, but you better pray that you don’t get any problems or questions because you’ll NEVER get help."
coinbase,ios,theiradminsuck,4,2022-12-01 10:07:31,"The layout and ease of use is nice. You don’t realize until you try another trade platform. For the ease of use, and the “settlement “ made easy from crypto to your checking account, you pay a small fee. There hasn’t been any long wait times like other platforms, like 7 days I had on a competitors site. Same with buying and selling crypto. Right now the fee vs ease of use: I’ll mitigate the fees and stick with Coinbase. However, I will look into other platforms and learn the layout. My experience is once you like something; greed shows up, and the fees go up. I hope Coinbase doesn’t try to “fix something that ain’t broken”"
coinbase,ios,Matthewkcopeland,5,2017-11-09 16:16:01,"I’m a regular Coinbase and GDAX user and have never had a single issue using either. I always recommend Coinbase to friends and family because it is by far the best overall crypto buying experience, and I know they offer the best path to crypto ownership. A lot of my reasoning is due to this app. This app is dead simple, is secure, and looks great. Adding your bank or card is cake. Coinbase is US based, practices the proper security measures like 2FA, and are insured in the event they are compromised. Fees are arguably a little high, but are clearly defined before every transaction, and you definitely get what you pay for with Coinbase. Use this app with confidence."
coinbase,ios,nonono not,1,2021-12-18 00:51:12,my review of them is zero. I was hacked for all my monies with them and they would not help. They would send emails and pull them back. The hacker changed my phone number in account. So everytime I did get a response they would say we need to your phone. So they texted everything to the hacker. I told the probably 30 times that my phone number was changed and they skipped right over that and said oh we texted you what to do. It was and still is a nightmare. I had to change my bank account and all my payees and income deposits. If you get hacked you will get no money back or help.  They will not listen to you... You will just be broke and screwd over. They are rolling in money and you have none. Do not trust them. All they care about are their assets not a thing about you!!!!

coinbase,ios,VSV_crypto,2,2021-05-14 00:56:35,"I like the ease of use of the app and the quickness on verification. However I have to say it annoys me that (comparing Coinbase’ value for a particular coin I like to buy with another exchange), I noticed that prior to buying the coin in Coinbase, the rate was a lot higher than the other exchange (making it more expensive for me to buy, hence hidden fees for Coinbase). However, when I did buy this coin in Coinbase, I noticed the market value was a lot more frequently changing and is a lot more realistic to the other exchange’s.

You promote Coinbase does not charge any fees but obviously you rig the app’s logic towards hiding your fees with this kind of twisted algorithm and behavior. Varying coin value transparency depending on whether the user has bought in the coin or not. That is complete robbery."
coinbase,ios,Garrettkman,1,2021-01-21 14:37:35,"Coinbase sounds great at first but with the 2% to 4% fees when putting non large amount of funds, the displaying of the wrong portfolio balance half the time, along with the poor customer service this app has cause me a lot of headaches. I would not recommend getting this app because I’m doing so if you encounter any problems you can expect to never get an answer from customer support and if you do get an answer it will be able 2 weeks and they will say nothing can get resolved. The professionalism on the app is some of the worst I’ve ever seen and they do not care about you as a customer or person they just want your money. I would recommend any crypto app over this one so look into binance for the best selection or bisq for the best decentralized exchange. I would give them 0 stars but it makes me give them 1 so they luckily obtain 1 star in this review."

I wish there was a little better way to find out information about how things work. And it’s not particularly their job to produce that kind of information but being a beginner do you like things easy and right at your fingertips. There’s some coins I’d like to explore but coin base doesn’t support them and I’m not sure why I’m sure there’s a reason and also I am reading about some people putting stop losses in automatic buy & saleOrders how do you do that all in all it’s just the right tool for me the fee seem a little high for trades
coinbase,ios,Qhsjduejnsjskaibs,1,2019-09-29 18:16:56,"It’s a nice app but that point is moot. After paying a transaction fee - they will then hold your funds for as long as they want (3 weeks in my case) with no explanation. How long will your funds be held? Nobody knows, and there’s no formula. I emailed customer service only to get a useless generic response. Meanwhile, while my funds were being held hostage, I lost 25% as the prices dropped... thanks for that. How can this be considered okay? That’s essentially a bait-and-switch, telling me I’m buying X amount but freezing it long enough for it to become significantly less once available. Not only is it unnecessary, but you have no logical reason for doing so. Oh and this is what I paid a fee for, right? Terrible business practice, and completely unethical if you can’t even explain why. Try a different app people, save your money and a headache."

It’s extremely unprofessional and frustrating that a simple matter to resolve is taking several days and weeks to fix. I wouldn’t recommend this App to anyone. I’m hoping another app is created similar to the platform of this one, but offers the customer service needed to handle issues with accounts or account questions. If I could give less than 1 Star I honestly would. Really disappointed with this app and not understanding why it’s still ranked to high, when they don’t offer and type of customer support."

Added multiple banks, debit cards, and PayPal to no avail. This morning, opened the app to try and transfer my crypto and account was locked. Customer service is useless and have zero access to anything. Can’t tell you why the account is restricted for “security reasons” can’t unlock your account, can’t transfer to supervisor or anyone else, can’t do anything really except tell you what you already know.

I tried contacting customer support, but that alone was a labyrinth with no real help. Finally was able to chat with support (which was AI, not a human), and it continued to say the same thing over and over, never telling me why my account would be ineligible.

Spent hours trying to speak to a live person hoping they could fix the issue and return my money but responses were scripted so got nowhere with that. Filed a dispute with my bank to get my money back so Coinbase just took half the shares of my current best stock that was trending. Called to complain and request my stock be returned but because my number was on file they sent me to an automated recording that said contact support through chat. No help there either. So due to all the fees instead of being up on my investments I’m negative. They’ll find ways to keep you from making positive gains. All that to say do your research and try a different app.

When the transaction confirms, I get my percentage, but it claimed it was put into my acct while btc is at $80,000+ which it is definitely not at (FEB 2024) so it worries me that I may be getting ripped off by this app. And there are multiple transactions like that.

I have used this platform loyally for years, however after an number of “info verification requirements” my account has been locked numerous times (I ONLY use Coinbase for investing/purchasing).

coinbase,ios,"Jeucy's Gifted Gifts, LLC",5,2019-06-20 22:59:54,99cents to buy and 1.99 to sell I feel like is a little ridiculous that’s 3$ of our money to possibly have our coin profit I mean if the profits are in the thousands then I guess it is ok another thing not able to Withdrawal my money that has been taking out of my account already with a notification saying money hasn’t settled yet but is out of my bank is almost me bribing this rating to 2 star they need to fix that ASAP a lot of people will not like that as I don’t if the money is lit of our account and you got your fees paid out money should be able to do whatever so we like FIX IT.
coinbase,ios,bbbc2017,1,2021-06-24 19:53:34,"So for one, they revoked my buying privileges  because my bank (at the time) denied cryptocurrency purchases so it denied a bank transfer. I’ve since switched banks and Coinbase says my buying privileges have been revoked permanently, they’re not going to give me a reason, and that there’s nothing I can do about it.
For two, I finally got accepted into the crypto earn thing after being on the waitlist for 2 years. I can’t answer their questions because I get an error saying “there’s been an error, please try again later” but it’s always the same. Try to connect with support, and I get an email saying there is no support but to follow their troubleshoots. Are you kidding? I wouldn’t recommend Coinbase to anyone, they’re catty and then being the biggest exchange with no support is just ridiculous."
coinbase,ios,Bane2.0,5,2018-10-08 11:58:44,Coinbase is one of the most user friendly platforms but also is very limited on what coins are available for purchase.  Some of the most prominent coins with the largest communities such as XRP or TRX aren’t even listed.  Besides that 100 dollar limit on spending a week on debit card for instant payment is nothing in an investing standpoint.  Yes you can use a bank transfer which would allow you spend more but it takes two weeks for the money to clear.  If some changes would be made to these issues Coinbase would hands down be the best platform out there.
coinbase,ios,Deja Louco,1,2018-11-14 15:47:45,"UPDATE: Came back to Coinbase just to see if they got better. The fees are still outrageous and then I was charged international transaction fees by my bank too, that's new!!!!!! A $40 bitcoin buy and transfer ended up costing me $45 after the $2 Coinbase and other transaction fees. Coinbase charges you $2 to buy whether you're getting $5 or $100. Again, I'm just gonna stick with Square. It's free to buy, send and receive. 

This used to be my go to app for bitcoin trading. But after a situation where an ACH deposit took over two weeks to arrive in my account..... it’s not practical for those who want to trade instantly. By the time the money got to my account, I had already started and transferred to a new Square Cash wallet in minutes! Coinbase Fees are extremely high and there’s no point now when apps like Square Cash and Robinhood will let you buy/trade FOR FREE!"
coinbase,ios,OhTheFuture,5,2017-10-13 20:41:37,"This is one of THE BEST apps for Bitcoin, Ethereum and litecoin. If just starting out, use this app. You will venture into other apps eventually and different places to store coins but start here. Coinbase has NEVER been hacked, yet, its best to keep large amounts of funds in ""cold storage"". Look up Canton Becker and paper wallet storage for large amounts. But Coinbase is great. Yes there are fees for buying and selling but that's capitalism. Yes you will probably pay small ""international"" charges through your bank. THIS is why we support new currencies. Invest and hold. BTC is up even when it's down. Buy low. Sell high(if selling at all). Gain BTC and thank me in three to five to ten."
coinbase,ios,Obyone89,3,2025-03-12 18:28:48,"I have the Coinbase iOS app, the main trading app, I’m not talking about the wallet app.  Starting several revisions ago to your Coinbase trading app we are unable to rearrange the “watchlist” in advanced trading mode.  

I used to be able to tap and hold on a coin and drag it up or down in the list order, that feature has been broken in the last several updates.  This is quite annoying because when you add a new coin and you may want to move it to the top or middle of the list.   As you add them now, they go to the bottom of the list and there’s nothing you can do about it. 

Please get your iOS App Dev  team involved and fix, thank you so much!!"

I’m losing count of how many times it crashes and tells me I have a “0” balance, and the customer service is HORRIBLE!  All you can do is “chat” with customer “service” & all they do is paste the same response, they don’t even read what you write and you can clearly see it by the repetitive questions.
Update:
I’ve been asked 3 times to verify my ID in 2 months and now a selfie is required.  Once I did they restricted my account.  Someone put my middle name as my last and then I was told my names don’t match.  After 3 frustrating days I finally got that incompetence fixed.  Now I’m locked from sending  my crypto to a wallet “for my protection”.  This company is HORRIBLE and a fraud!"
coinbase,ios,RandyCrow,1,2023-05-17 14:17:59,"I like how easy it is to purchase assets on the app. However, they make it very difficult to track how your investment is doing. I even messaged with a support person who couldn’t communicate to me how I can see the average cost of my purchases so I can se my overall P&L. Not a very intuitive app for anything other than buying more crypto, but I guess that’s where they make their money.

Update. I looked at the note the developer sent about the tax settings. I’ve done this before and understand it’s use. However, this doesn’t bring back the view we had literally a week or so ago that shows me a consolidated view of my all time +- for the account and each asset. I just want that feature back. Changing my review to 1 since they don’t seem to be able to give me a work around to that."
coinbase,ios,maxomite,5,2021-06-23 13:20:21,"Let me skip to the biggest concern I had after reading so many reviews: withdrawing funds. I had read of people that were left unable to move money back into their bank so I tested it out with a small sum. The first few tries DID cancel themselves. The third time I tried withdrawing to my bank account and it worked right away.
Also afterward I realized it initially failed because the debit card on file was expired so no fault of coin base.
And speaking to their customer service I have contacted them several times and each time was prompt and helpful."

I got a notification about suspicious activity, so it locked my account. Yet, the transactions still went through. It took countless emails and phone calls just to regain access to my account. I just realize now that my account is restricted and I can ONLY BUY, but not sell of course. After an hour long chat over the phone just to figure out nothing and they tell me to email someone else. I receive emails saying they need more information for the case, but don’t say what information is needed, and it takes days just for a response. Easily the worst customer service I’ve had to deal with."

It’s so convenient to get started and approved. The app is easy to use and navigate.

No wonder there stock is crashing hard since everyone is watching them scheming crypto buyers. So it’s been a while since this post, nothing has changed too bad I can post pictures but for reals I this company is stealing from us, no wonder the stock and investors are driving it down.

It will not verify me and I’ve given up hope of getting any assistance from these thieves. I watch my money bounce around but I can’t touch it.

coinbase,ios,navco598,1,2020-05-10 19:35:38,This application would be great if they had any type of customer service. I had an issue where a purchase was reversed due to a minor banking issue. When I tried to fix the issue the application would not let me so I tried to call customer service to get help and they automatically locked my account. Do not try calling the customer service number or they will lock your account. There is nobody available to call and emails take hours to get replies which do not fix my simple issue. I need the account unlocked and I need the application to allow me to add a funding source. This is taking 2 to 3 days to fix if at all. For the size of this company they should upgrade their non existent customer service deportment. Use this application very carefully and don’t expect any help if you have a problem.
coinbase,ios,Modifly06,1,2019-09-23 13:30:03,I’ve been dealing with a customer support issue for 5 weeks now that it’s still unsolved.  Coinbase systems will remove my card unannounced saying it was a “bank problem” I called my bank and there’s nothing wrong with my card there removing it for no reason!!!  I start working with the management team for the payment after there associates couldn’t help me and there just as bad.  Louis Jacob and Tristian are all horrible managers there.  Jacob and Tristian rudely hung up on me without a reason.  And still dealing with this issue Louis has the audacity to tell me that my account had been resolved and I’m in the wrong when the idiots at the account specialist team didn’t answer my question.  This is completely unacceptable customer service.  If your looking for a good customer support staff when your spending your hard earned money look elsewhere

LoL I start doing a few things here switching things around and made more money! Just having fun but if you are serious about crypto this is the right place to settle in. Everything you need is right here. If you are new to crypto it teaches you all you need to know with easy instructions. Have a Blast!… I am see you inside.
coinbase,ios,bhobo03,4,2018-12-02 06:04:24,"If you love your money. Don’t go to this coinbase. This kind of investment is unstable, there is no guarantee with your investment. Out of curiousity I tried to invest $100 dollars. I started like 6 mos ago and never have I seen it gained. The value keep depreciating. I’m down now to $20+. It’s not the app whoxhas the downside but the market for bitcoin. Right now it does not have potential on this time. The way I see this potential will grow will be in the future. So whoever is going to read my comment here, I gave you warning. But if you want to try also out of curiousity, it will be on your risk..The app Itself is good but the bitcoin market, I give it a -10 out of 0. Trust me better invest your money in stock market."
coinbase,ios,thepodfather,3,2018-06-15 22:52:25,"Coin base is a trustworthy and solid platform. It’s one of the few places you can turn fiat into a crypto asset. 

However, they only support 4 different assets. In a landscape the changes almost daily, they seem to have stalled a long time ago. If you were looking at the crypto market and exchanges as features, this one is very feature poor. Like a computer I can only send email, but not browse the web or anything else. They don’t support Ethereum tokens, or the majority of the top 10 assets in the world. In order to exchange and hold any other assets, have to move your assets to another exchange and hold them there, or in your own wallet. I have a feeling they will soon disappear for lack of support in this market. Evolve, or wither away"
coinbase,ios,Mysfyt,4,2017-12-28 22:13:01,"I used coinbase to buy my very first bitcoin, litecoin, ethereum, and now bitcoin cash. The process was SUPER easy. I had never dealt with cryptos before, so I needed a ""for dummies"" kind of app. This was a perfect starter, and is also a wallet, which made it really easy for me to buy and store my coinage. I have noticed that there is a lot of down-time, especially when pricing has huge fluctuations. And the fees charged on transactions are a bit steep, but for someone that's just beginning, I'm not going to let it upset me. My one request: PLEASE ADD RIPPLE (XRP.) My ripple is sitting on an exchange site, and I'd like to have everything in one place in coinbase. Plus, buying more ripple would be an awesome feature because it's gaining momentum."

In this case both. I even had to give them my drivers license picture originally but now they don’t recognize the number of that drivers license when I don’t even think I gave them the number they just had the picture. It’s like your data has expired with them so it’s becoming impossible for me to log back into this app even though I don’t really have that much money in the app I’d still like to be able to login I mean, I’d rather not lose a couple hundred dollars cause they like to forget who you are."

coinbase,ios,WorthyxWear,4,2024-04-10 01:13:44,"period. If you’re NEW to crypto , here’s some advice , buy cheap crypto. About 5 of them . Track the fluctuations, when you’re comfortable, invest more and sell when it’s high . KEEP WATCH . Keep checking , if you’re interested in day trading , you’ll pretty much have no life lol but it’s how bad you want it . Do your homework. Fr fr . 50$ at a time. Use profits to purchase . Never go outside your pockets . Like I said use only your profits to invest . Then gradually increase your investments. My Respects! One less star only because you can’t have it done automatically and fees are a little higher than most I’ve come across . Nonetheless great for starters ."
coinbase,ios,Shteve Findley,3,2022-02-15 13:52:25,"Ok let me start of by saying the app is great, very user friendly and easy to maneuver. My gripe is in the fees, i know Coinbase needs to keep the lights on and fill their pockets (as well as deal out crypto through their learn & earn program 👍 good job there), but man… there are fees out the wazzoo. They aren’t massive fees, but the frequency of them adds up. Im sure there’s better ways to operate the app to dig around those fees that im not doing, but thats just my personal experience. I recommend if you’re looking to set up reoccurring crypto investments because i dont think the fees apply there, but if you play the game and trade often those fees can get crazy. All in all I didn’t lose any money 👍 just a little profit."

My info was correct but the app just wouldnt open or let me do anything. I contacted support and i got the response “hi we are closing your account, you can either donate your money or take it out.” They did not give me a single reason as to why, and i no longer have access to my money in it. This should not happen, especially without a reason. They literally just blocked off all access to my account, from my phone and everything else. I never did anything suspicious besides i guess holding ethereum? I know i didnt do anything to get my account closed and they wont even talk to me or help me get my funds out.

App interface is sluggish at best on current gen hardware. App harmonization is terrible. Honestly, I find it challenging to even agree that the content is well organized. You got multiple places to find similar but not identical data. Top gainers can be extremely misleading without a delineated time frame explicitly mentioned. You need a separate app to do your research before proceeding with “informed transactions” to be fair. This app, looks popular but runs like some Google Play store overlay from India….there’s way better stuff out there to do your crypto trading on. Even in 5G UW and 500MB downstream Wi-Fi environments, data takes several seconds to load even after a clean respring. Undesirable at best."

Emailed Coinbase support team multiple times about unauthorized transactions but customer support did nothing for my case report except that they are investigating it and emailing generic responses one after another. Just told me to reset my password and report to law enforcement. Every time you buy or sell a crypto, it cost a fee. Robinhood or other trading platforms are much better. This is ridiculous customer support and sketchy trading platform, don’t know where the high reviews are coming from. This app doesn’t deserve even a 1 star rating but -5 stars rating!!!"

Not only are their fees high, they are making money when you sell. Check the  price before you sell because these guys are stealing from its customers on the way in and on the way out. I would recommend you purchase elsewhere unless you like your money taken away. So save yourself the headache. I will be making it known on social media with proof. Believe me, I will be heard."

I tried contacting the support team via email but they did not give me a reason as to why I could not use my fund as soon as I bought them. Right now they are sitting in my wallet with no use because it won’t even let me cash out but my friend bought some and got his fund almost immidiately. Coinbase took my money and did not give me the cryptos in return. I also tried trust wallet and they gave me the funds almost immediately so if you are looking for a safe option I suggest you go with Coinbase because it does not work for everyone.

It is gaining momentum at a rapid pace and you don’t want to be caught in last place. They even pay you in different coins  and all you have to do is let them teaches you about them. Easy money and you get an education. What more could you ask for? So hurry up and check them out. You’ll only be doing yourself a favor. If you’re still not sure, maybe jump online to check out a few videos to warm you up. Cheers!"

The bad: Unfortunately, the fees on Coinbase are very very high. There’s fees for converting your cryptocurrency and fees for selling your cryptocurrency. It really digs into your profits. Also a huge issue I’ve found is that when you buy or sell a cryptocurrency you often buy at the highest price, and sell at the lowest price. If a stock that is currently trading at .60 cents but was .74 cents 20 minutes ago you will pay .74 cents it seems. I used this app for a week and then took my money out. The fees and lack of updated market info really dissuaded me. Coinbase Pro is a far better option, even that has some fees compared to competitors."

Once I was able to log on, I missed the right moment to sell. I sold at the moment I was back in, however, my sale canceled. 

To make matters worst. All of my funds disappeared, completely gone as if they never existed. After trying to contact support for two day with no response, my funds finally appeared, and the sale did not go thru, making me miss another crucial moments and profit. 

   How can a platform charge so much money for incredibly terrible service.

I am with that particular company currently under investigation, I didn’t feel safe leaving any of my money there. So, I came back to Coinbase.

coinbase,ios,Shrubs1234,2,2025-01-17 00:44:34,"Easy to use, but metrics as to what you buy and sell at are really off base from what you see and think you buy or sell at. My example multiple time selling at a certain coin price and by the time the transaction comes through it says that my selling price is 4-5 cents per unit lower than what I set it up for. Which I understand how this can happen, but I go back and look at the diagram and chart and it shows nowhere where the price I sold at ever really hit. So either the company is taking part of my profit which 4-5 cents over the course of thousands of tokens is a lot to scrape off, or their diagrams are so far off base that it’s impossible to get and accurate idea of what prices really are. Which is it!?!?!?"

Customer support (Praful) was completely unhelpful. They kept dodging my questions about why I was restricted and refused to escalate to a manager. All they would say is that I’m “no longer eligible” to use the platform for purchases, deposits, or linking payment methods.
The most frustrating part? I had completed all authentication requirements and was literally just moving funds between two Coinbase products - can’t get more legitimate than that! While they say I can still withdraw my funds, being kicked off with zero explanation is unacceptable."

At times, purchases for some have been blocked when prices go down. I assume they wish to sell their coins at higher prices. It’s basically rigged. I will take my business elsewhere where my business is appreciated and the fees aren’t so extreme. They’ve lost another customer. There are many exchanges such as:
Bisq, Binance, Kraken, Hodlnaut, Coinmama, Bittrex, Gemini, eTori and BitStamp.

coinbase,ios,LoriBarber,5,2019-05-27 15:56:06,"Do not deposit any Crypto that you want to withdraw from immediately after because the process can take over 30 to 45  days sometimes even longer but the wallets are terrific for both deposits and withdrawals and the vault just showed me a big profit by not being able to withdraw it from my bitcoin account immediately after, deposit into the bitcoin vault money you want need for at least a year but they should give a timestamp on a letter of withdrawals until the funds are sent back to the wallet for withdrawal or to transfer the funds to your designated payment account."
coinbase,ios,Videoalex,3,2021-02-24 04:16:12,"My main complaint is with the portfolio view. It charts money deposited as a gain in the portfolio, when it should only charts the performance of the portfolio’s coin assets. Robinhood does it this way. I want to see what my gains or losses are in a currency I have to tap into the portfolio, tap into a currency, then manually add up all the deposits I made to buy a currency. This is silly. At the top line where it says “you have $80 in Bitcoin” it should also say “you’ve converted $30 fiat to BTC” at least sum up all my investments into a coin at the bottom for me. 

I want to be able to look in one place and see “I’ve put $600 into crypto and your portfolio is worth $800”

The second half you have, but that’s useless to me without the first."

I don’t really get into the Defi side of things but if you into NFTs and having a secure wallet then I recommend you hit download 🎯#Cryptocrazy"

Finally found out a way to get my money back again charge me all kinds of fees and it still doesn’t show in my account that the money was deposited I STRONGLY RECOMMEND DO NOT GET THIS APP !
coinbase,ios,Jeinabean,3,2017-11-21 03:48:04,Only issues I have is when you want to get on Coinbase and it is crashing and you have no access.  Usually this is during big crashes or spikes when you most want to buy it or sell it.  Also my fiance has been unable to sell money at all because it is telling him to verify another for of identity.  (He has bought and sold before so it’s just now asking for another for some reason). He provided another form and it is not processing or accepting-  it’s been going on over a week.  He read online this has locked up some peoples accounts for months.  Hopefully he has access soon because we are trying to sell his funds to pay for our wedding and honeymoon.
coinbase,ios,GeesUpfgjj,1,2025-02-23 17:25:27,"This app is awful from start to finish… Coinbase shows you more Crypto that YOU CANT TRADE than you actually can trade. If you want to trade the others, set up a wallet. (That should be fun if you have no idea about such things) then proceed to wait anywhere between 3 days and 3 weeks for your money to settle. And if for whatever reason, Coinbase doesn’t see it fit to release the money. Not only can you NOT WITHDRAW it. You also can’t trade with it. So it will just sit Stagnant. They also scam you into a monthly payment. Because without, the FEES ARE OUTRAGEOUS! And the Coinbase wallet fees! Sometimes are larger than the amount you’re actually trading.. 
Use Robinhood or Webull. ThinkORSwim, TD Ameritrade. Literally anything else. Oh and lastly. If you’re not rich, you will at one point have your own money hostage."

One field in particular that constantly changes location on the app is the account’s “Cost Basis”which should be paramount information to the user. Since I’ve been an active user of the app it’s switched locations (without user notification) and has even just disappeared completely. Again, pertinent information to have as a user. The lack of notification to the user on when interface updates are delivered and overall complication on how to access certain fields in an intuitive way create a bad experience for the user."
coinbase,ios,1cmon,5,2024-03-06 16:34:59,"I’ve been a crypto enthusiasts for years and Coinbase has always been my main exchange.

 The only downfall of Coinbase is that they do limit the assets available to acquire and leave out some crucial projects unless you are willing to pay a ton on eth fees to use Coinbase wallet for those trades. Most issues people have with funds being frozen etc. arise from not adhering to laws such as KYC. I’ve never had issues with Coinbase.

Overall, if you’re new to crypto, you can’t go wrong with Coinbase and they are publicly traded as well if you’re a traditional investor."
coinbase,ios,Toepaw,5,2022-03-15 00:06:32,"Let me start by saying that my crypto journey started as many others, excited, nervous, and lack of knowledge.  I was very hesitant about several of the Centralized Exchanges, CB being one of them, but I can honestly say I have had nothing but a positive experience the entire time with them.  I had tried others and they felt scammy and lacking legitimacy but never once has Coinbase made me feel that way.  They are a premium company with premium features and my experience has been outstanding with this company.  Thank you Coinbase for all that you do in the crypto realm!!!

The one time I needed them after all the money they make off of me. They couldn’t help. They just kept the returned coins. And closed the support ticket I opened. I’ll use another exchange."
coinbase,ios,GuitarSDIII,2,2023-01-17 16:22:23,"If Coinbase didn’t offer 4% back on their debit card I would never use this company. When the card works, if it works, the 4% is nice. I have saved hundreds this way. Thats why I still use the card.  On the downside
1.Debit card only works at certain vendors and you wont know till you try to use it
2.Often you get insufficient fund notifications when trying to add cash from a bank even when your bank account has more then sufficient funds
3.Often your bank account will get tapped for the amount you tried to transfer to Coinbase only for it to be cancelled and returned days later.
4. Customer support will never help you, they will always pass you along to someone else or disconnect you all together, deliberately. 
5. There is No Manger ever to talk to. 
6. You cant get a complaint through, the agents just give you a run around.
7. Huge Fees For Crypto Transfers, go to another platform for trading.

Basically, use at your own risk because Coinbase will most likely do absolutely nothing if your money gets lost or for any issue really. They do nothing. But the 4% back nice lol."

Plus they give out free crypto all the time, I know for a fact I've earned more with coinbase earn than I've paid in fees by a long shot.

I wish apps like this would let you know if they will not connect with your bank so you don’t waste your time and effort trying, not to mention giving them all your information up to that point which I’m sure they sell just like every other company or app out there.  Bottom line, I’ll stick to the accounts I already use for investing.  I was interested in Coinbase maybe being a better option, but at least the other service I use will actually let me invest."

Conversions state no transaction fee but portfolio valueis always a few dollars or a couple of percent of converted value less. I would prefer optimum conversion ratio with explicitly stated fees. I understand all this is complex for crypto conversations and there are brief window of volatility! Coinbase is big enough to absorb some of that risk which I appreciate. Also rocks that you can pay or withdraw to PayPal. 

I am amateur active trader in relatively small amounts. Some percentage on cold storage for HODL. A solid app that can use some improvement to get to 5 stars"

If I want to purchase OR SELL 20K-50K of bitcoin in one day or even one week, I can't do it...I'm capped at 15K/week.  So those features have to be improved if they want to compete with all the new wallet sites coming out.  

And their fees are WAY TOO HIGH.  I love the app but they HAVE to resolve these issues.  

And they need more people who can assist people over the phone.  Very irritating to have to wait days for someone to email me back.  But I do really like the app"

After reading CB site and learning all about crypto I began to think how fun this was…to strategically maximize my wealth.  The coolest thing to me is certain main coins…like Solina, have “drops” for new alt coins and you get em before anyone else has them. It’s like a thank you for holding onto your assets.

Unlike other sites that are constantly at you to review your experience on their platform, Coinbase have left it to me no pressure. In a word my experience has simply been AMAZING. You can buy, convert and sell any time you want without a hassle. Frankly for me one thing I really appreciate is how easy and simple it is to withdraw directly to my bank account. Without any doubt or hesitation, my go to exchange is Coinbase."
coinbase,ios,ravenb2021,3,2021-10-21 14:49:22,"Coinbase does NOT let you “explore” the world of Defi. They hand pick a bunch of coins and tokens and decide you can buy/sell to/from Coinbase at a freakishly huge fee (although other brokers charge high fees too). 

On Coinbase, you get real crypto- not like on robinhood or SoFi, but remember that nobody should ever ever ever keep their crypto on any exchange or hot wallet. Sure, Coinbase has good security they say, but keeping crypto in Coinbase or Coinbase wallet is extremely stupid and will be very sad when it disappears. 

Everyone should have Coinbase but use it for as few transactions as possible and keep your crypto in an air-gapped hardware wallet. The big institutions (such as Coinbase) don’t want you to use truly safe cold storage because then they can’t enjoy all the custodial perks. 

There is one very good thing about Coinbase: the debit card. It should be used as little as possible (enormous transaction fees), but it is the only way you can get instant spending power or paper cash from your crypto rather than having to wait for the clearing periods between banks."

coinbase,ios,nice to know you.,1,2021-05-29 01:44:19,The description says if you have problems you can contact support. Well that’s a lie. The only support offered is for security if you want to lock the account or if you have coin base card with them. There is no link anywhere on the website that allows people to contact them if your issue is not in their database and/or their recommendation does not work. So be careful. I surely would not want to have any money tied up with a company that does not at least have email support and I can’t imagine the problems that would come if someone did have a lot of money in their accounts with no one to speak too. Very shady if you ask me. I see some people saying they could email the company. Can someone tell me what that email is? I can’t find a link anywhere within the site.
coinbase,ios,Robertrhoe,1,2021-05-19 15:39:09,"Inasmuch as coin base solicits zero fees for exchanges between cryptocurrencies, they will take between 2% and 5% of your total balance under the guise of “timing” for each and every conversion. It is statistically impossible to lose that much money on EVERY conversion/transaction in a 5–10 second span of time that it takes to make the conversion/transaction. Coinbase understates the value of a crypto when you own shares. Then, they overstate the value of a crypto when you do not own it. So, when you purchase/trade with an undervalued crypto to purchase in overvalued crypto, you are losing a lot of money! This is like Joe Byedumb claiming that he is not going to raise taxes and then turns around and spends trillions of dollars to stimulate inflation! Inflation is legalized theft and a tax! It devalues your spending power under the guise of “lower taxes”! AVOID COINBASE! THEY ARE THIEVES!"

Now I’m staring at a potential profit and can’t touch it. I’m trying to find another platform to move it and so far it is proving difficult. 
 Also the “rewards” they offer are trash. Every time I try to claim them, whether it be in app or online, I get caught in a never ending cycle of error messages or loading screens. There also been several times app has crashed leaving you without access. Coincidentally while you stand to gain. I recommend avoiding this app altogether.

 Don’t know if it’s a bank thing or you or both!?!?!?!? This is very aggregating!!!!!! Also, can’t transfer funds instantly to the Trust Wallet app my bought crypto using my bank account because I have to wait until next week for it to go off the Coinbase exchange.

The website says that with bank transfers the bitcoins are available to withdraw or transfer in 3-5 days. 2 weeks later they are saying that due to improvements being made to their service that my ability to withdraw or transfer is on hold for another 2 weeks. This is fraudulent and the purpose is for Coinbase to steal your money. They will charge you above market for your bitcoins then wait as the value drops to release your funds. Steer clear of this company and at the very least do some research. There is a reason they have an F rating with the better business bureau.

I feel safe and trust my investment are protected and when I buy, trade, or cash out on here and I’m not being gouged with fees that I was unaware of like two other platforms I tried when I first started investing. And it’s the only platform I know that pays you to learn about the different assets being introduced. It’s not much you might think 3$ is a lot. But it says something when you have 56 Million registered users that processes a trading volume of $335 Billion per quarter!!"
coinbase,ios,Z_Beast,1,2024-02-02 16:52:30,"The interface and usability is amazing. It allows pretty much anyone the ability to get started in crypto, and the yield is nice for someone who doesn’t have the know how or desire to manage their own assets across different platforms. 

But that is where the usefulness of this app ends. The ability hope of Crypto is Ownership. That is not the case with Coinbase. They will give you the luxury to trade on their platform as long as you abide by the rules. Have a mishap and they have no issues locking your account, pulling money from assets that have “already cleared”, and keeping the account restricted. 

You pay $30/month for 24/7 help but all you really are paying for is them to read you policies and offer no assistance to whatsoever. And that is even if you can get through to someone. I feel sorry for those that have to utilize the chat function. 

This app is best for your grandma or grandpa who want some direct exposure to an unknown asset. Take control of your own assets and move them off the brokerage for they own the crypto, not you, and they have shown that to me - personally - on a few different occasions"
coinbase,ios,Rojoconn,3,2023-01-28 10:16:43,"For all the money Coinbase makes off its customers with every transaction, you would think they have enough money to figure out how to make logins work, recurring transactions go through, and stay online during volatility. They haven’t.

I’ve spent thousands of dollars in fees on this platform over the years, and if this wasn’t the biggest platform to onboard new people, I would never use it due to all of the inefficiencies. They’re lucky they’re best in town due to lack of competition, but it’s just a matter of time before they’re beaten by a competitor who actually invests in the usability and scalability of their platform and as a bonus, in the privacy of its users."

I don’t know if they were having computer glitches or what was going on but now I have lost almost all of my money my friends have lost a great deal of their money and Coinbase doesn’t care. When I execute a trade I expect it to go through.  I am devastated. And I’m not the only one. (I want to know if Coinbase registered my attempts to set a stop loss?)

I would not use their wallet or anything else when sending crypto they will often not show up in your account with the support unable to help giving random fake reasons why it can’t be done even though the Blockchain shows everything. 

Even their contact us support form doesn’t work properly. It’s seriously nothing but amateur hour and headaches when dealing with Coinbase I would give zero stars if I could. If you are just getting into crypto stay far away from Coinbase they will scam you before you even know what happened"
coinbase,ios,Shiesty Worm,3,2021-12-06 06:01:08,I like Coin Base. It’s actually a cool set up with plenty of options. I understand the company needs to make money. I’m a business owner and totally understand. It’s the fees on the buy and sale part of it.  Also the part where you want to sell and your stuck almost giving money away to a shiesty worm waiting to collect. Then its Gandalf who says You Shall Not Sell until you give us some of your risks. I get the fees but offering and waiting for the light to turn blue meaning whoever set this up is very smart and greedy. I love  the way you guys work.  My risk is rewarded when I win. But I lose too but you guys take no part in that only if I eat I got to deal with the mooch. Happy Holidays. God Bkess

Even after doing all the research on the app, it was a waste of time and more importantly money. This app is here to make money, and that’s not a problem, I imagine they have to maintain the servers it takes to run all this programs, yet every thing you do from start to finish will have a charge on it, from buying stocks, to selling them, and also when you cash out, they make fees for every move you make, so they always make money, from the moment you put money into the account until the moment you leave the app. The best part is when the fees says $0.55 to cash out, and when you hit cash out it goes up to $1.78 for no reason. Man this was a never again app."
coinbase,ios,FunkyMonk93,2,2021-07-05 23:56:54,Using now for about 3 months. My first and biggest issue is that there is no clear way to see how much you’ve made or how much you’ve lost on each crypto you own. Only way I can do this is figure out how much I bought compared to the current price. Other big issue is with the portfolio view. You can see your total worth there but does not tell you how much you are up or down. Biggest issue with the portfolio view is that it only works 50% of the time. When it is not working all I see is a sine wave graphic with a $0 balance. Lastly it looks like I am paying about 2-3% on every transaction. Surely there can be another way to make money off of me without the gigantic fee.

It will front me up to $35,000. So when I see a number that gives me the chills I can say “buy my $50 of Doge and wala it’s done. No this is not a paid review. Thank you Coinbase for making my life easier. This is my ticket to the MOON BABY. Have a great day and by DOGE!!!!"
coinbase,ios,itsjustyouandmeminer,5,2017-12-22 06:16:12,"Review #1: Coinbase (App)
Pros: Great UI, smooth even though what I would imagine would be times of heavy traffic
Cons: Data Between the app and the desktop site seem inconsistent, almost as if they run off of two different databases, which can be frustrating, especially for newcomers doing ID verification, etc. Veteran users might not experience any issue at all.

Review #2: Coinbase (Company)
Pros: Y’all are a bastion for U.S. cryptocurrency consumers trying to get some honest coin. Other bigwigs in the industry dropped us folks from their list of priorities :(
Keep fighting the good fight!
Cons: Hire more people. Seriously. I know you’re already on it, and I know it’s tough, but it can’t come soon enough. I’m sure this will help improve your ID verification processes, etc. and if it doesn’t: please work to improve it. Getting an error message about a verification that failed for an “unknown” reason isn’t acceptable, in my opinion. It leaves folks out in the cold wondering “wait, what went wrong?”"
coinbase,ios,waterfrontboi,1,2021-02-04 14:34:16,This app is a scam. For most people you’ll be investing in something you have no clue about and hoping it’ll work. But if you’re like me and able to make a few hundred off it in a short time Coinbase penalizes you. The stocks that start to go well will lose support from Coinbase and you’ll lose your shares or they exchange it to a less valuable coin. Basically they’re gimping you when there’s a chance of success. On top of that when you want your money you’ll have to wait for it to be an “available balance” which can take up to 7 days. Imagine waiting a week to access the money you earned from the stock market. Highly recommend boycotting this brand they’re just as deceitful as Robinhood. Do yourself a favor and get Binance or Kraken. I cannot stress enough how terrible my experience has been trading with Coinbase.
coinbase,ios,Kassra Farah,1,2017-12-27 19:43:20,"1. Their updates are NOT on time; you’ll lose money without even thinking of it, and you’ll be behind on actual price changes.

2. Their alerts don’t even alert you via notifications. I have 4 separate alerts on LiteCoin alone, and none of them sent me a notification when triggered... you’ll lose opportunities to make money with this alone.

3. Their support system is shady and unreliable. They use a Auto-Response Robot to try and help you out, and if that doesn’t work (which is the case), they send you a like to “Contact Them,” only to be sent to a page that essentially says that we are only helping people with compromised account and lost passwords, everything else is irrelevant. So forget about being able to ask a human for help, and the fact that they’re having so many issues with compromised accounts alone definitely says something.

Don’t waste your time and/or your money with this app. Now that everyone and their mom is going into Cryptos, I’m sure there are other apps that are MUCH better and cleaner than this. I could’ve made $50 today if ONLY the alert system worked; learn from my experience and look elsewhere for a crypto-trading app."

The platform is really tailored to ease of use, with many safeguards to prevent a novice like myself from getting carried away. Great for anyone looking to invest in cryptocurrency for the first time. I’m sure it is probably great for seasoned investors as well, but i haven’t gotten to that point to say for sure. Still learning of course. But so far love it!!"

coinbase,ios,Annoying popup,1,2024-11-07 06:59:27,"tldr; take your business to other platforms like Robinhood and IBKR. When trying to place a trade, Coinbase prompted me to sign up for Coinbase One in order to save on the trading fee. I signed up, but then Coinbase still charged me the full trading fee (it was 2%!!). Trying to contact support was a nightmare. Virtual assistant is garbage, and then the actual human agents were equally as unhelpful (lots of waiting around for them to ask internal specialists for guidance, but then the end the chat if you don’t respond immediately). After connecting with 3 different support agents, they finally said that the trade was placed right before the Coinbase One subscription kicked in. Even though I literally signed up through the prompt advertising the waived fee if I signed up (which I did)."

Also is there anyway that it shows how much you’ve earned?

coinbase,ios,Ninja_Steve,1,2024-03-01 00:53:15,"DO NOT USE THIS APP—IT IS A SCAM. I exchanged over $80 for cryptocurrency to make a purchase. The app fees were more than the amount of cryptocurrency no matter how much or how little I tried to transfer, so there was never enough available to use in other transactions. Even after exchanging cryptocurrencies for USD cash within the app, it would always say I had $0.00 available to cash out. I even waited several days for the funds to clear, but then they just completely disappeared. I lost all the money I put into this app, and was never able to use it to make purchases with cryptocurrency. This was absolutely designed with the intent to keep any money invested. It is a complete scam, and I believe it’s main use is for pig butchering scams. DO NOT USE THIS NO MATTER WHAT YOUR “FRIEND” OR A DEVELOPER SAYS."

I understand the markets have been down but the only ones making money off crypto in coinbase is coinbase (from all the fees they charge). To top it off, I got a new phone and now it has locked me out without any way to get back in. I can’t close the account because “I have pending fees”. And yet, I can’t get into my account to pay those fees and close out my account. I’ve had the account for over a year! I’ve only lost money even with dollar cost averaging. Coinbase is a scam!

After speaking with support I was notified that those payments aren’t supported and I must link a bank account, although I don’t have one only Venmo and cash app. Hence the reason for crypto to eliminate banks and discretion, correct? Although I had to confirm my ID with pictures and stuff, yes that was done but I don’t want my identity out there for many reasons. Plus side, this app is very user friendly and has the social networking of Facebook to help learn more about it. 2 stars but I would say there is more cons than pros unfortunately."

They will also claim that ""slippage"" is responsible for such a ludicrous fee, even though coinbase, like most other brokerages, takes advantage of something called ""internalization"", this practice is when a brokerage keeps a large amount of securities or crypto on their books in order to facilitate trading and guarantee liquidity. In other words, when you buy on coinbase, you are not buying on the open market, youre borrowing fully fungible liquidity from their own hot wallet. Slippage doesnt apply when you arent using a decentralized liquidity pool. Again. Dont use their service."

It’s not in the in-app notifications and the order history is listed by when the order was placed instead of when it was completed.

When Robinhood opens up more crypto options and wallets, CB will lose me as a customer if this hasn’t been added. I do understand that crypto fees are a bit of a necessary evil, but to have to juggle two Apps (CB and CB Pro) in order to get lower transaction fees is beyond stupid.

The Coinbase card is very limited. If you think you are getting something comparable to your bank card you will be disappointed.  It’s a pain to load money on it as it more often than not it tells you your loading source has insufficient funds when you have plenty of funds in your bank account.

However they hide fees and expect you to dig in and find these so called conversion differential fees etc. They should list all fees even if it’s an approximate on ALL transactions. I brought this up to their live chat.

 I’ve had a suspicion coinbase does “maintenance” or otherwise keeps you from access during heavy market movement when spike or surges happen. 

 Sure enough, matic jumped over 25% today and coinbase keeps looping me through the login process so I can’t access or trade. 

I open the app, go to login screen. You go to login, it does email/password/text verification then directs you back to the app… that stays on the same login screen.

Possible issue with phone? I thought of that too and tried opening in chrome on laptop. The app “doesn’t recognize the device” (which it NEVER does because I use an f’ing vpn) so I verify through my gmail. Coinbase conveniently leave out part of that is verifying that access… THROUGH THE APP YOU CANNOT LOG INTO!!!

They do this on purpose. If you encounter this, pull phone logs to show the condition with date/time and speak to an attorney about fraud/insider trading from a broker. Also report them to the FTC.

They did this same crap in 2021 when doge and Shibu went nuts. Collect device logs for each occurrence and build evidence this only happens during heavy price movement of your assets.

Doesn’t really matter if you had it in the terms that you could change the offer at any time. Offering something that cannot be redeemed immediately and then taking it away is a clear-cut case of bait and switch.

She has few thousand dollars in the app, she did nothing illegal or suspicious, just regular trades in amount of somewhere about $200 to $500 weekly. We tried to contact the support multiple times but there is no response whatsoever. No phone number to contact, no response to any email, or the support form that I filled many many times. They don’t care about customer, make sure you know where you are putting your money."

Plus it’s a lot of fun. And a great way to learn. I had zero training on trading but was able to self teach my self on this app. I made a few mistakes, but was able to learn from them and tried not to repeat the mistakes. Absolutely one of my new favorite app to use. Aside from the few glitches the app needs work on. It’s still my favorite."

Continuation of my Locked account for over a month now with over (19 thousand dollars in it at one time) unable to get to because my DMV license expired and the DMV is closed due to Covid pandemic.  Customer service don’t care and don’t have the capability to to fix it they say.  And they restricted my wife’s account as well even though her ID is valid just because we are connected.   Horrible customer service.   I would rate them a zero if it was able.   Done this to a friend of mine as well.  They don’t  accept valid retired military IDs either.    You can deposit your money but then you won’t be able to get it back.

nah, my account is COMPLETELY INACCESSIBLE. For no apparent reason. And now it’s asking me to authenticate my identity as if I’m suddenly a new user? What is this foolery?? DO NOT sign up, DO NOT provide information, DO NOT, DO NOT, DO NOT!!!
Pretty sure this is a scam site as of now. I don’t know if it actually had anything to do with the covid pandemic, but that’s when my account was suddenly inaccessible- about a week ago to date. I doubt it though. Just don’t get this app, seeing as how no one has been provided any answers. Go with something more established and well-known. Paying a fee for your financial security is better than completely losing an investment without one."
coinbase,ios,screw you accept my name,1,2025-03-15 15:22:25,"I have been having a lot of trouble with the Coinbase app and the support team. I encountered a bug on the app when trying to convert USD/USDC, that randomly withdrew $50,000 from my bank account without my approval. Coinbase keeps locking my account for days at a time. I was in the middle of a short trade on the app when they locked my account, i cannot close my position and have lost thousands of dollars. Coinbase won’t even tell me why my account is locked, and told me it will take 6 days to look into the issue. I have had almost $100k on this exchange for almost 10 years and they refuse to even tell me what is going on with my account. I am losing trust in the Coinbase team and am considering moving all my assets to another exchange."

I thought that Coinbase was the safest and most trusted exchange until my balance showed up at $0.00. Coinbase’s help center has not been helpful as I’ve called 7 times and wait a total of 2 hours and haven’t been able to reach anyone. And even through the chat center I haven’t been able to reach someone. Also when I’m converting my one cryptocurrency to another there are apparently no fees but somehow Coinbase takes my money by not converting enough currency to the other. I predict that in the peak on the runs Coinbase won’t be available to use but I hope so… we’ll see I guess.

Not to mention user interface makes whole process very easy. Everyone especially US based customers should have a Coinbase account."
coinbase,ios,TexasSkyCaptain,2,2021-10-22 19:18:37,"I have enjoyed the Coinbase platform and for their dedication in educating the public on cryptocurrencies. It’s UI is easy to use in its simplicity, making it apparent they’re target customer are inexperienced investors. 

However, after signing up for the recurring buys promotional where you are paid $10 after your 4th and 8th consecutive recurring purchase of $50 or more, I never received the reward. When I reached out to customer support, I received a very generic response that listed the terms of the promotional. I read them and didn’t see how I was not eligible, so I sent a follow up email asking why I was not eligible. I then received a snarky, unprofessional email thanking me for being “understanding” when they would not provide why I was not eligible. 

Coinbase has been great. But after how they treated me and are not transparent with their rewards program, I cannot trust them to handle where I am storing my money and cryptocurrency. 

I would highly recommend improving your training with your customer service agents. Worst customer service I have ever received."

I have seen multiple people reports of the exact same problem and apparently this exact same thing happened about 4yrs ago to people. Yet, somehow in that time we couldn’t have made developments to prevent this problem in the future? This is unacceptable, and you CAN’T CLAIM problem is solved and wipe everyone that was affected under the rug. I hope you guys fix this, if not lawsuits are bound to follow.

I wish I would have just stuck with Robinhood even though they are being dragged through the mud they aren’t taking a big chunk of every transactions into and out of their platform. Advertised to seem like most services are free but not the case. I just hope nothing I have in Coinbase skyrockets I dont wanna see that fee when I want to pull out a decent chunk of money.

The $5 Bitcoin was there in my account one day and then the next time I logged in it was gone. I then experienced the WORST customer support ever. First they told me I didn’t have an account! I sent a screenshot from the app to prove my account. Then I got an auto reply that my question was being transferred to a specialist. Over SIX weeks later, I got a generic email about troubleshooting such as updating the app. I was so frustrated that I went in to cancel my account only to find there is no ‘close account’ option. What a horrible app and horrible experience! I know they run ads promising crypto rewards if you sign up. Don’t take the bait!!!"

I had my password saved on my phone so there wasn’t anything wrong with what I was doing.  Contacted their customer support which was snail mail which led to more incompetence by their team.  Still trying to get into my account and it’s not letting me change my password to get in.  I messed them my problem and they just sent me a message on how to change my password.

coinbase,ios,ciesielnator,5,2020-12-27 22:00:39,I highly recommend purchasing all your crypto currency's on Coinbase. First and foremost their security measures are very very good and thats very important especially when investing in Cryptos you want your money to be safe and Coinbase’s protocols keep your money safe more so than other crypto exchanges that can get easily hacked. I enjoy their quizzes and the awards they give you upon finishing the quizzes. I am also looking forward to the Coinbase debit card that allows you to purchase goods using crypto currency’s very exciting!!! In conclusion there is no other crypto currency broker I would use other than Coinbase they rock!!
coinbase,ios,Dannoall,3,2021-02-06 07:11:20,"You would think when converting on Coinbase from one crypto to another that it is a 1:1 ratio. That couldn’t be further from the truth. I literally lost $200 in 2 transactions, not because I did it wrong but the exchange rate was different. The amount of $ that it said I was converting was a few cents less than what I had which seemed reasonable. Then with one click of the button $200 gone and not coming back. 

So I tested this woth $5 and converted multiple “tradeable” stocks and in 3 trades o went from $5-$3. That is a 40% loss of my money for converting with a “0%” fee! 

I will be leaving ASAP! I just have to figure out to get my d@mn money back that Coinbase stole from me."
coinbase,ios,Angry Beaver Metahuman,5,2018-05-30 02:32:27,"This is probably the best and easiest way to invest, transfer and receive bitcoin. Transfers and deposits are easy and I will be investing into whole bit coins in the future. They give you updates on the Highs and lows of trading and have incentives for customers. Although I should remember to use my referral because I would of gotten a small kickback for my efforts for referring friends .  That is not what it is all about though ! It is about being sure of your investment and having a multi os/platform support.  It is about being able to securely and confidently invest, sell and manage your finances."
coinbase,ios,Chriswoke,1,2019-05-02 00:55:46,"This app does absolutely everything it can to make sure that you LOSE money.
They make sure you’re already going into your investment at a much lower amount than than you paid for because of all their fees (A lot of hidden and misleading fees) then they make you pay to sell your coin back and they always charge you more for the coin than is displayed and they make you sell it for UNDER what is displayed.
 So for example, Bitcoin was purchased at $13 per bitcoin more than the displayed price, to sell it I would have to sell it for $7 under the display price (then they add the Coinbase selling fee) do you understand the percentage amount it would have to grow for me to break even off an investment like that? It’s near impossible. And the app knows that, the algorithms are set to profit."
coinbase,ios,DanielPR13,5,2017-12-17 00:52:21,"It has annoying features, but overall a fantastic crypto marketplace that makes it simple and easy and the fees are relatively low.  Downsides are the 5-8 day wait times to credit your account after purchases, the relatively low spending and cashing out limits and the difficulty selling one or another crypto currency for others. I recommend this for entry then moving to another marketplace like Bittrex etc for crypto trading.  One thing to note is Coinbase is FDIC insured making it a relatively safe investment especially as long as you are below $100,000."

This data can quickly tell me if I’m buying/selling high or low (or a dip or peak) based on my average buy in of that crypto. Without this basic data this app looses a lot of strategic utility. I can’t use the app as I need to and I may have to switch to another exchange/app. Like I said, the purchased cost average data was there for each crypto under My Assets, but the last update removed it. So hope there is an update that changes this back soon. Great app, just missing basic useful data."

No luck. I made several attempts to get it lifted via Coinbase’s support and it took them more than a week to tell me that they can’t help me. It’s very reminiscent of when Robinhood stopped trades on $GME when it was having a boom. I’ve been a member of this platform since 2017 and have now switched because of this issue. I’m never looking back.

Update: I’ve already contacted support before. Seems like the team on here ignored that statement. They’ve already told me my restriction can’t be lifted and I’ll take their word. Advice for people looking to get into crypto - don’t do it on Coinbase. Save yourself the headache."

The addresses that are “mine” or “yours” are actually Coinbases with millions in each. I advise getting it out to trust, not because of that, but because the company throws a fee/waiting period/ or just straight up added $2 on the Tellor(TRB) coin for my last purchase. They claim it’s a spread for fees, but they’re either robbing you or they made this app for disabled children. Legit got a calculator on this and 3 other devices in a 4 foot radius. It’s so simple it confuses me with less information. This is just a purchasing app in my opinion, WITH Coinbase one because you might choke and die from them shoving fees down you esophagus."

They don’t have a free form option that I’ve seen where I can report a bug so I’ll do it here. Long story short didn’t start happening until a recent update. If I go to my watchlist and try to move stuff around it gets really glitchy and the coins don’t move up and down on the list.

Reasons I would change Rating to five stars: 
1. There are transaction fees with every purchase and make me question reoccurring purchases and get painful with bigger trades. 
2. The app doesn't offer a good way to track the performance of your investment. It only shows percentage change of the individual coin, but not your personal gains/losses. That would be a nice feature to have."

It’s easy to spend your money here, at least. I presume that is their primary concern.

I was asked to provide a case number. There isn’t one. I’m just a user rating an app. I did find that the “news” section is now hidden among all their ads instead of the dedicated section they once had. Removing a star for getting such a useless response from the developer."

Turns out they use a service that stores your bank login as plain text and sells you transaction history to advertisers. Then I was speaking with a coworker and he reminded me that Coinbase last year refused to comment about BLM, shut down all social justice discussion at the company, and told their employees they could quit if they didn't like. Well, many did quit. Recently there's been some articles outlining their barely-legal business practices and the upper management's exit strategy. Even the most libertarian person around would cringe at some of their work. If you have any crypto on this app, transfer to another wallet before they go down!"
coinbase,ios,imitating.jpg,2,2021-05-26 02:49:17,"Apple doesn’t it make it clear where to report this, so I will start here in the review section. 

I got a pop up today that stated very generically: “Get the most out of your experience with Coinbase. We need permission to ensure the content we share is relevant and personalized to you. We take your privacy seriously.” At the bottom was simply an “Allow” or “Not Right Now” 

As a user, I found this confusing. I had no idea what I was either allowing or perhaps possibly denying - perhaps some app functionality? I had a funny feeling this had to do with ad tracking, but I honestly couldn’t tell from the message itself. It definitely stopped me on my tracks and not in a way that may me feel good about continuing with this app.

I’ve created several tickets (for the same issue), but what happens is they send me an email then I explain the situation a little more and they respond with the same generic answer which doesn’t solve my problem. Part of the issue is when they respond they create a new thread so the new customer rep can’t see the whole discussion. Please do something about this I’ve been locked out of the app since mid-October!!! 

I was locked out of my account after I tried to upload my drivers license, but didn’t realize it was expired. According to Coinbase’s guidelines you only need to upload an ID if you’re withdrawing or depositing cryptocurrencies. But my account is locked and I cannot buy/sell with the funds already in my account. 

I would love to give a good review because the app functions great, but due to the customer service I can’t recommend it to anyone knowing they’re going to deposit hundreds or thousands of dollars to possibly be locked out of their own account while following the app’s guidelines.

This isn’t necessarily because Coinbase is spectacular, but more so because Coinbase is one of very few digital asset platforms that haven’t given the community a significant reason to distrust them. 

Great user experience, and they continue to innovate. I’m sure a better — and non-custodial or even relatively decentralized alternative will come around eventually — but Coinbase remains the top dog my miles."

One of the benefits is SUPPOSED to be 0$ trading fees. So I set up recurring purchases to make the most of it, and when I went back one day to look at all of the purchases I had made, some of them were still charged fees!! It’s absurd! Imagine being $30 dollars a month because they claim you get 0 trading fees, and then come to find out you were still charged fees -.-. Not cool coinbase, not cool. I hope everyone sees this. I’ve been trying to get my money back on fees for weeks now, but their responses are all automated, just like the ones most companies send out to appease their upset paying customers. Pretty shady activity overall if you ask me"
coinbase,ios,lemonshrub,1,2022-06-24 18:52:51,"Coinbase is running a promotion promising $50 for staking Ethereum. They describe this as a simple two step transaction. Only after purchasing the Ethereum (for an almost $8 fee) Coinbase then explains that staked Ethereum cannot be easily sold, and provides no timeframe of when it can ever be sold. This leads to a situation in which you can easily pay Coinbase $15 to buy and sell Ethereum for no reason.

Support was unusable on my iPhone, and after working with support for an hour on my computer the support agent did not read my query at all and started sending me pre-written replies about how transactions work on coinbase.

The only saving grace is that coinbase is so poorly integrated with my bank that I don’t think they’ve successfully been able to actually charge me for this mess."

TD AMERITRAY AND Robinhood ARE the best but they have limited Diggital currency to trade. Coin base need to upgrade where customers can click on the portfolio and gain Or loss can see in individual coin or as whole investment where I stand as of today gain or loss. Plus coin base doesn’t sent you tax paper for filing tax . Horrible. I think AnchorUSD is getting better . The most important pro of AnchorUSD is that buying and selling is free

This feature is a quick snapshot of the entire market.... when it’s gone we have to find other alternatives to this information.

Basically any question you ask, you get the response there is only a limited things they can do. Also, there is limited information they can provide for you. Coinbase must have forgot customer satisfaction is the #1 key to being a successful company. I would have gave this app a 5-star rating if their customer service was not so horrible. If this issue is not resolved properly, I will be using a different crypto platform. Does any one have any suggestions on a user friendly crypto platform?"

About 1/4-1/3 of all buy request need resubmission due to failure. Fast movers overload their server and you get lock out of buys frequently. The portfolio balance comes unsynced and is completely wrong from your actual balance, making a quick glance of your current balance broken. Attempting to contact the company for support through their page doesn’t address this issue, and their automated message system is a bot that never gets you in contact with a person. 

So, in summation… neat concept. I’ll be looking for a similar app from another company that works better. This one is too broken to bother with."

You need to do all sorts of work on your own to keep track of where you are. And conversion rates are always way higher than initially quoted. I tried to convert a grand of one coin to another and now the transaction amount is marked at well over a grand, outside the range of figuring price variance during the transaction. I convert a coin at say 10 per coin and when I look back at the receipt it’ll say 14 per coin. That’s a big difference! Coinbase takes advantage of the fact that other crypto platforms are even worse."

That’s after my first purchase of $100 that was held 4 days and no bonus. I’ve been waiting to transfer it to Coinbase Pro and I still have 3 days left!!! If I have to keep waiting insane amounts of time to use my cryptocurrency I will have to find another exchange. Really!

This bank transfer cleared my bank after 2 days. They held my funds for 5 days- for no reason. And In the meantime, BTC price dropped significantly and i lost a lot of money. 

I would give 1 star out of 100 if I could. They do nothing for you when you have a problem. There is no phone support agents or chat support, WHY AM I PAYING A TRANSACTION FEE IF YOU GUYS ARENT GOING TO BE HERE TO SUPPORT CUSTOMERS WHEN THERE ARE PROBLEMS!?"

It would be nice if this could be changed instead of it always being the default. The vast majority of times I’m just trying to put money into my USD wallet to transfer to another coin. Just recently however, I transferred to my bank on accident and there is a 3-4 business day wait for that. This has been my only complaint so far after iPhone X issues were fixed."

Like another tab after “hour, day, month, year, all.” Then it showed if my purchase is up or down so I don’t have to click on each token and search to see what the price was that I bought each one at."

They have never told me why this happens, what I can do fix it, or information I need to change or what not. Looking it up on their support hasn’t really been helpful either. There are no clear articles outlining why I might have encountered this or what I can do. If it want for this I would’ve given in 5 stars, but since I can no longer do anything meaningful with the app for no apparent reason, it gets a 2. Fix this."

I found that to be strange since any transaction I did to withdraw money would usually take 5 business day to complete. When I contacted Coinbase customer service they told me there was nothing they can do. Unbelievable, a publicly traded company who prides themselves in security and in one moment all your funds are gone. And they’re response? “Sorry there’s nothing we can do.” They claim to protect your account. They claim to offer theft insurance. All LIES from someone who had experienced it firsthand.

You can link it to your bank account for ease of transferring funds to your cryptocurrency wallet. The transfers take a few days but I have not had any problems with this transaction.
   The one thing that is missing is, in the app it doesn't state the price per coin when you purchased it. It states the current value of the selected cryptocurrency, how much of it you bought and the total price you paid. Yes, you can figure out the price per coin using those numbers but it would be a nice addition to a solid app."

I contacted customer support and got an automated reply with no real answer within an hour. I replied restating my case and then haven't heard back from them for about a week. 

They essentially stole my litecoin aka fraud and are not even acknowledgeing that they are having issues with deposits into GDAX from coinbase. There are hundreds more that I've heard from that are having the same problem and I am. Many of us are considering taking legal action for their fraudulent business practices.

For the latter, the app would tell me to wait “5-10 minutes”, and then in 10+ hours (!) you get a generic email that it was unsuccessful. It seems Coinbase should pay more attention to testing error paths and provide user friendly error feedback - especially given their servers seem to be experience utilization spikes quite often.

No emails or notifications about this subscription across that whole period. They offered me a $30 refund (of course this is without accounting for the fee they charge just to withdraw money from them to your bank).

coinbase,ios,"13540986;84""8",2,2024-12-18 04:10:53,The fees on Coinbase are honestly insane. For example if you buy something like xrp and the price is 2.50 you’re going to pay an insane spread. Looking at around 2.55+ per share plus a fee. So you’re already starting out way in the red because of the high spread fee. The market doesn’t fluctuate by 5 cents a share so I’m not sure why they charge so much. And they don’t return the difference they keep it. I understand they’re running a business but I think it’s a bit ridiculous to charge such a high spread on top of fees. Especially if you’re paying for their premium service. The app is  great and it’s super easy to use but there are definitely other apps that are just as good with lower fees.

The platform displayed a “balance” of an unspecified amount, leaving me completely uncertain whether it was due or available. This lack of clarity caused unnecessary confusion and made it difficult to make informed decisions about my account.

As a customer, I believe it is crucial for any business to be transparent and provide clear, accurate information. Unfortunately, the lack of distinction between “due” and “available” balance made it challenging for me to manage my account effectively. It’s essential for the service to improve their communication to avoid such confusion for their customers.

I reached out to customer support seeking clarification, but the response was not as helpful as I had hoped. The representatives seemed unaware of the issue, and their response only added to the frustration.

I hope the company takes this feedback constructively and addresses the problem promptly. As a user, I value transparency and reliability, and I urge the service to prioritize providing clear balance information in the future."

 I’ve been using CoinBase since 2018 and have watched it evolve over the years.  I’m still loving it and log on almost every day.  There are fun ways to learn and earn new coins that most would otherwise never have exposure to.  Some have netted some great rewards‼️.  It would be silly not to take the quizzes and new new coins and learn about web3 and it’s protocols.
 Definitely DagNabbitRabbit Approved‼️"
coinbase,ios,jamesccowart,3,2021-04-08 06:33:35,"While I must admit that Coinbase has a nice user interface and it is easy platform to get navigate and use, it certainly lacks plenty of pretty basic functionality that you would expect in an investment app, such as displaying the average price of coin for your investment amount- meaning you’ll have to do plenty of math because the lack of a very basic algorithm. Another would be implementing an automatic buy in and selling amount at a set price, which would make everyone’s lives easier. If these pretty standard simple algorithms and features were implemented, everyone  would use Coinbase."

I keep sending them email asking for them to let me have my access back but they keep delaying. I have not had access for 8 months now. This is unreal. I have lost a good chunk of change since then because I can’t pull my money out. They told me twice over an automated message that they’re closing my account. They unlock my account but I can’t access due to google authenticator not working, then they close my account, restore my account, lock it back up, and keep going around and around in circles."
coinbase,ios,Hubbap03,1,2019-07-20 21:51:52,It is very rare that I write reviews but Coinbase has screwed me over for the last time.  I am not a new user for them.  My account was active for many years and made numerous transactions. This past week I deposited money to my account which they in turn put a very long hold on for no reason.  Now that the hold is over and I can get my money away from this garbage company they have coincidentally removed my bank account that I just used so I can’t withdraw my money.  I can’t add the account back because it says Coinbase has to reactivate it even though I just used it and it has been attached to my account for years.  There are to many other quality wallets to put up with such blatant disregard for customer satisfaction.  Go elsewhere and save yourself from the hassle.
coinbase,ios,phcun,1,2017-12-06 13:34:02,"I bought $2000 in bitcoins and I got an email saying that it could take from 3-5 business days to process because it was a bank transfer. It’s been 6 business days and nothing. The money left my bank account the next day and I can see the transaction in the app but it does not show the virtual money. I contacted customer support just to find out that the chat is pre-made answers and when you ask the system keeps asking you to rephrase because it did not understand. I finally found a way to reach customer service by email and I sent them an email and I got an automated email saying that they’re very busy and I it could take days for me to get an answer. 

Horrible experience. I just want to get my money back and never use this app again."
coinbase,ios,Username_JP,3,2025-02-07 03:49:31,"I’ve been using Coinbase for a while, and one of the most useful features was the ability to see the average cost of a coin, how much I was up or down for the day, and performance breakdowns by hour, month, and year. 

This was essential for tracking my portfolio and making informed decisions without having to manually calculate everything. Unfortunately, Coinbase recently removed this feature, making it much harder to keep track of individual coin performance at a glance. 

Now, I either have to manually track these numbers myself or use third-party apps, which is frustrating and unnecessary.

For a platform that prides itself on being user-friendly, this feels like a step backward. I hope Coinbase listens to its users and brings this feature back, as it was a major value-add for investors who want quick insights into their holdings.

Rating: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5) – Great platform overall, but removing essential tracking tools hurts the user experience."

I don’t know how I’m going to unlock my account and access my funds again but I guess that’s a tale as old as time considering everyone is going through it with this garbage app, at this point IM going to sue them for doing this unlawful practice of keeping my money and pretending to lock my account for any plausible reason just so I can’t access my funds.

Oh correction, I can receive crypto in to my Coinbase account but I can’t send crypto out when it’s for, “my security”. Let’s not forget their update to their user agreement that says they can take all your fiat and crypto u hold on their exchange in the event they claim bankruptcy, which is right around the corner.

The hidden fees and terrible customer service finally caught up. Both Coinbase and Coinbase Wallet gave me problems and had money stolen.

My Coinbase card was compromised and used for several hundred dollars. I called to let them know several minutes after and was told they couldn’t do anything until the transaction completes. Hopefully the merchant “denies the transaction”. Once they obviously didn’t, I called back and was told I needed to wait 10-45 days for claims to be processed. At least I got 24/7 customer service so they can listen to me vent all day. (And no I haven’t gotten any word yet.)
Also when you buy crypto, the price you’re quoted at is always higher and when you sell crypto, the price is always quoted lower when the transaction completes. I’ve seen this before but not to this extent, it’s not even close. No even paying for their service helps so you get scalped out of money in multiple ways.

You’ll sign up, it tells u the first two steps are done after u give them your info and verify your bank. It says the third step is to buy crypto but when I go to do that it will say You’re not authorized to buy crypto” and gives u the standard web help address that tells u nothing. 

You have to click on your profile and then go to Features(even though there is no alert or anything to tell u that). Then you have to do a “feature upgrade” which involves uploading a photo of your drivers license. They won’t take any other form of ID and u can’t obscure any numbers in the license. I’m not sure why not, because u don’t need my license number to verify it’s my license. But with all the security issues these kinds of companies are having, I’m VERY leery of giving full copies of my id out. 

Would u like to call and chat or email them a question about their policy? Good luck. U get a generic contact page where u have to enter in mandatory fields that have nothing to do with a general question(transaction number?).

Our referral program is fully automated. Note that we are unable to manually review or credit any referrals that are not automatically paid out. We are unable to provide specific information as to why any referrals may have been deemed ineligible.

A few of the more common reasons are that the account was created but not completed or verified, or that the account has not fully complete a purchase up to $100 worth of digital currency.”

My account is verified and my first investment was $100. Plus I made additional investments that day. Basically, they’re saying something may be wrong with our system, but we don’t care and aren’t going to investigate. 

Why should they care? They make sure their system works well enough to get your money when you transfer money in or out.

I wonder what else is glitchy with their systems that are handling people’s money? Time to look for a better app with people who care if their system is functioning properly or not. Of course their automated system will charge me another fee, I’m sure."

  What does this mean? It means if you are buying XCOIN for $1.00 at the current rate posted on their app/site, each share/coin will cost you $1.03 or $1.04 no one can explain to me exactly how they calculate it. It’s a percentage so even very inexpensive coins rack up a bigger expense than if they just charged fees upfront.
  Also if you are selling a coin for $1 you will only get $.96 for it, or if transferring from one coin to another both will be charged “margin” so you are paying twice.
   Worst of all, if you are JUST Moving your portfolio from Coinbase to Coinbase Pro, you are charged margin on EVERY piece of coin you move (to use their app none the less).
   Couple all of this with the fact that it is IMPOSSIBLE (not exaggerating) to speak to a human customer service agent on the phone. All customer Service is done via email at an average of 2-3 days per response.

I have never used another crypto trading platform that hold my money from me for weeks and there is nothing k can do to get it back. And they have a pretty big transaction fee compared to other places. 
Update: they’ve been holding my money for over a week now, and when you talk to support all you can get is a robot and you can never talk to a real person. And if you choose to wait to talk to real person, you’ll never receive a call back or nothing. They’ll just ghost you this is the trade crypto on.

I ask them about it and they tell me that I need to pay the amount that love already given them to resolve my account. So to sum it up they charged me 3x the amount of my purchase and told me to wait 10 days instead of the standard 3-5.

I understand the servers could be overloaded but this is a serious matter. Most of the people would agree that if their hard earned money disappeared they would be angry.

I understand the buy and sell fee. But the fact you can’t sell all your holding at once and they lower amount to lower of what you have is sketchy . Also the cash out fee said .50 cents and then it charged me $3.78. What is up with all the fees. Buy/sell/deposit . This company is for sure going to profit for that reason because it’s taking away from all us . Millions of people using it and those fees will add up . Be careful people only use companies  that you trust and who knows what info they are selling about us .

It will lock your funds behind an “SSN verification” form that could be impossible to pass, if you’re unlucky. 

This is absolutely unacceptable. Not only is it impossible for me to give this form what it wants, despite the pretty obvious fact that I am a real person with an SSN, but it will LOCK ME OUT for 24 hours if I try to submit it more than 3 times.

Not only that, their customer service is perpetually overloaded. I can’t contact them at all, and apparently emails are taking several days just to receive an answer. 

This is, as far as I’m concerned, a form of theft. They retain control over your assets as long as you can’t pass their broken ID verification system. If you need access to your full funds, you get the shaft instead."

I actually bought cryptos on a different platform and sent them to my Coinbase wallet and now I can’t even WITHDRAW that money because it shows my account as disabled. Customer service is the absolute worst out of any platform I’ve ever used in my life. I literally can’t believe a company can be as big of a joke as this one.

Meaning that I had to dispute charges or wait for their pending charge to go away which some times lasted for up to 92 hour periods, which is the limit my bank allows pending charges. When I reached out for help their response was that they couldn’t do anything after the charge had been placed. 

The platform is visually nice. It’s easy to buy coin. And they have protection measures which actually saved me from sending currency to a scam. However, this does change the fact that the transaction cost is so high and they continually made false charges to my bank account."

I like to look and see at a glance how much I have invested total and how much up or down I am total without having to go into the app. Having the individual cryptos broke down are nice but first and foremost to me me widgets are for big picture.

The Bad.  I recently noticed that the rate for selling my assets is never as higher as the rate for buying AT THE SAME TIME. At first I was a novice and thought this was normal with crypto. Now that I use multiple exchanges, I learned it isn’t true. This time I was smarter and did a screenshot. Under “Home” the rate was $5.04, when I went to sell, the sell rate was $5.02...I backed out and went to buy, the buy rate was $5.06 (the rate shown on all the other exchanges btw), I went back again to sell and it was at $5.01, all the while Home and Portfolio said $5.04. 
I searched the support page for an explanation...Nothing. Emailed the company...no response. Usually they are very response. 
Now I see they are going public. $.05 difference being retained without explanation on assets is suspicious to me. It concerns me. 
And no this was not the gas fee; it was the listed rate.

It takes money from my bank account within a day of my order, but takes another SIX DAYS to credit my Coinbase account... and the fee schedule isn’t small enough to rationalize it with respect to that. They only have four coins and two of them are kinda garbage. Ethereum is the only one I really buy, because transfer fees are lower than BTC and it’s very exchangeable on other exchanges. 
Pros- it’s easy to use... pretty intuitive. 
At the end of the day, it’s fine, but if there were someone else with the same thing and shorter bank-to-exchange transfer times, I’d use them instead"
coinbase,ios,Textjason,1,2018-01-08 17:49:23,"First issue: So you can move money from your bank account to your USD wallet in Coinbase without fees. However, your bank transfers it and it’s gone immediately and Coinbase sits on it for 5-7 days, before it shows up in your wallet. Im sure they are collecting interest in your money before they move it to your account.

Second issue: When you do have a funded USD wallet and try to use it to buy digital currency, at least bitcoin cash, you are not allowed to chose your USD wallet to purchase be digital currency with. The app forces you to either choose bank account or credit card, with the higher fees for both. Why can you not choose the funds you already have deposited with them?

Third issue: If you choose to use a bank account to buy digital currency, then once again you wait 7 days for the purchase to be made. With the volatility of digital currency, this make Coinbase and obsolete tool.

You can use your USD wallet to trade with GDAX, but if your not buying that way, there is zero point using Coinbase.

For me the hunt continues for a digital currency wallet that actually works, makes sense, and isn't a rip off."

After locking my account out of frustration, I was required to wait 24 hours to reactivate, and now I have to wait another 24 hours before I can send to a friend. Meanwhile the price of Bitcoin has dropped, and Coinbase has no doubt been making interest on the money that they refuse to let me move.  Outrageous!"

Despite reaching out to them over a dozen times through email, I was unable to resolve an issue with connecting my Coinbase card to Apple Pay. The responses I received were generic and lacked any helpful information. When I reached out to their online customer service, I was told that it is not possible to connect a Coinbase card to Apple Pay, and I was directed to a website to do my own research. This was unacceptable as my original problem was that I was able to connect my old phone to Apple Pay, but not my new one. I find it concerning that such a large company with a market value of 15 billion dollars can have such poor customer service."

Oh and coinbase will charge you for coinbase one without permission and in advance of the posted subscription date. They’ve offered no help in transacting a refund. This company actively works to steal funds from customers any way possible, all while providing zero customer support.

coinbase,ios,ChuckMore,5,2021-10-03 16:40:20,At urging of multiple friends I stopped buying lottery tickets and started buying Crypto with Coinbase and found it to be more fun than scratching off tickets in the grocery store. I realize there are more fees with Coinbase than other exchanges but like the simplicity of the app. My one request is adding Purchased Value under the Total Balance number. This would certainly inspire me to increase my weekly buying and provide a way to easily show friends and family the rewards of buying crypto on Coinbase.
coinbase,ios,Dekker78,1,2021-11-07 01:15:06,"smh ridiculous high fees to buy AND sell. Also need to wait 10 days after you sell to withdraw your money to your bank account. You can try to use your debit card to cash out on but if during their verification process you have to close out the verification window to check on your pending transfers then you have to wait 12 hours before you can even attempt this again. Graphs are kiddie graphs and are absolutely simple and never move until you refresh your page and even then it only changes to the time that you treated. The graphs never move without a page refresh. After I am finally able to withdraw all funds, I will never ever touch this piece of trash again - 100% promise."

I’m still on the ETH staking wait list, but I plan on taking full advantage of it once it’s made available to me. 

My only recommendation would be to add the average crypto purchase price to the “My portfolio” tab. I’d like to be able to compare the current price of a cryptocurrency and the average price I bought it at."

I tried getting in touch with an agent but they don’t even have a customer service line. Then they repeatedly email me that they transfers are irreversible! Like I DIDN’T CHOOSE TO TRANSFER!!

I had $1500+ money and wanted to withdraw it as I had invested in crypto. And they started pending all my transactions, though I continuously submitted my documents and all. My investment went from $1500+ to $600 just because they never let me trade or do transactions for last 3-4 weeks. All my money is gone and the one thats left that will be taken by them I believe because I emailed them many times. They have no helpline call remember and resolve the query and ticket with some computerized answer. All the reviews seem fake to me now if they can do this to my account I believe suffered many out there!

I like that you can see what the fee is going to be before you buy something not afterwards. I also like that you can transfer one crypto to another for free. Lastly getting paid to learn about different crypto is cool and you’re not stuck with something you don’t want because of the transfer ability and this is a good way to make up for any fees you spent on buying assets.

I tried to submit my passport but it kept saying I had already passed verification.  So now I'm at the highest level of verification but it still won't let me buy sell or transfer money in or out. I try contacting support to clarify things but they keep saying I need to submit additional ID like a passport. I try explaining that their website tells me I've already passed verification to the highest level and it won't let me submit anything else. They've stopped responding to my emails now. Why do I even need to submit my passport or additional ID? Am I just supposed to take a picture of my passport and email it to them?  Who does that?

Coinbase hasn’t emailed or messaged me about this on going problem lasting over 2 days now.. 

On top of that they are holding my fund 3-4 days after they have already received payment through my bank.

But I can’t even sell. Not withdrawal cash. Not buy. But sell. I have lost 25% in profit this weekend. I have been on hold for over 2 hours on the phone only for it to disconnect. I am currently waiting for a chat rep. It has been 5 1/2 hours now. And all I want is to be able to sell crypto coin that I own. There are so many similar horror stories. It may never happen to you.

Feel free to hold a million dollars of your crypto here; just know that if something happens to your funds, no one who works there will help you. There is no phone support. They never review past support tickets. You will never get your issue resolved because Coinbase doesn’t actually care about its customers-they KNOW you have limited options, which is why their customer support is awful."

Now Coinbase has frozen all my wallets, and I can’t even withdraw them to a different wallet. And with ZERO customer service, I’ll be locked out of my funds for an undefined amount of time.

coinbase,ios,elrodhomeskillet,5,2022-05-26 15:54:55,In general Coinbase is really easy to use to buy cryptos that they support. The only issue I have is the amount of time it takes for prices to change. Many times I bought and sold based on the value of cryptos on Coinbase and they were off by enough to make the trades unprofitable. In fast moves up or down Coinbase lags behind and obviously it is very profitable for them to make moves buying and selling knowing that everyone on Coinbase is seeing numbers 5-15% different than actual prices.

To developer: I have already contacted support and sent screen shots of balances and issues. Was even told that you locked in prices when exchanging even during fluctuations.

It’s okay I understand that happens but what burned me was the deposit, buy and sell differences. For one it seems EU bank accounts have free deposits if I’m not mistaken. Lastly, if buying the price is at market value to sell they impose a .015% cut at the current value. Well that is over a hundred dollars . I’m thankful I caught that. I’d recommend GDAX TO SELL .

Also trying to view what you started with in a coin and how much it’s increased or decreased is a hassle. Must actually calculate how much you invested each time and total it.

coinbase,ios,4th of 4,1,2017-12-13 00:43:03,"Don’t use this app expecting to be able to buy when there is a dip in the rate or sell when it is going up. This is especially true with the apps so called “alerts”, which should more accurately be called “Ha ha! You missed it, but the staff got it”. I have literally been on the page and gotten multiple alerts one of the coins was dropping below or above a threshold I had set yet it was impossible for me to buy as when I went to process the payment it is what it was before the dip or rise. Often times these mythical rise and falls then don’t even show up in the charts as a high or low. 

The app has often been unavailable during peak volumes for “security” upgrades.

You also can not have the app default to making purchases from your wallet instead of a bank account. So I need to keep changing that manually (and then the dollar value you planned to buy/sell is set to $0 again).

This app might be fine for an occasional sale or purchase. But with the long time delays between notification and actual price changes and there being so many false notifications it is more frustrating than useful."
coinbase,ios,Common Truth,5,2024-03-22 13:40:06,Newbie’s Beware !! Stop paying these marked up prices with shameless fees to add insult to injury... Coinbase is for ignorant investors who have been mislead by Googles results. Why pay more? ALOT More when Ro****hood doesn’t mark up or charge any fees for trading Crypto currency Sad to see how successful Coinbase has been ripping people off... How can you hold your head up Brian Armstrong? What your doing is not cool. Your no better than the unconstitutional FED banking fiat system and the people that support it.

All they have to do is send me a simple email. They cannot even do that.

I provided my ID and selfie for verification but it’s still suspended. I cannot add, withdraw or send money to invest on something.

I was very impressed with how informative and facilitating the management, content and scripting teams had seamlessly provided a platform that was simultaneously elucidating and easy to use, fast and functional in myriad ways. The team shows unparalleled leadership in the space. I am obviously a fan of all it’s iterations! Great work!"

The cons that I have notice is that you are limited to how much you can invest at once(this may be a security feature for the company), there is more than a 2% spread when you convert your coins resulting in a dramatic loss in fiat currency(where the company states it can be more or less than 2% spread depending on some factors), and the same goes for investing into the coins($1000 with a $14 fee somehow became $980 instantly).

I recommend investing your money, wait for a good time to withdraw, and continue on that path.

I personally find other apps better and more clear but since I have money tied up in this app and the customer service is good I will ride it out for now."

I’ve been trying for the past 5 days to withdraw the small amount of tether I have in my account but I’ve ended up depositing another $100+ because of fees/gas AND I STILL DONT HAVE MY WITHDRAWAL!

The ONLY way to get rid of this screen that blocks access to prices and significantly reduces the app’s functionality is to buy a crypto asset. My account is fully setup, but this stupid splash screen that blocks asset prices will never go away because of this asinine design choose.

On top of that, I did profit off of some shiba inu coin and when I transferred it into a different currency, my entire portfolio balance dropped by $100 with no explanation. And no, the value of the coins did not plummet within the 1 second that I transferred it. From 9:59am to 10:00am my balance is missing $100 with no explanation and Coinbase SUPPOSEDLY has zero fees but that’s a lie cuz they’re robbing you.

I had an issue with my account. I created a ticket and was told a “specialist” would be in contact with me in 4-5 business days. I have now waited 3 weeks. I’ve created new tickets that have been merged into my original one. There was been no response to any of my attempts at communication. 

I truly believe something at Coinbase headquarters has caused their customer support department to go extinct. I don’t know if it’s a meteor or a flood. How this is not bigger news is beyond me. But I’m writing to let the people know. 

It’s a real shame. Money is involved when dealing with Coinbase. I really wish they took it more seriously and were more driven to be true to their word.

Problem is it was never sent and after trying over and over again, still no email. I have reached out to customer support but based on prior experience I may never hear from them.

I can’t get anyone at Coinbase to fix the issue, they need a “specialist” is what response I received after a week long email conversation.

The support verification runs you in loops to nowhere and automated messages.  It very much seems like they are trying to frustrate you into giving up and letting them keep your coins.  Even the new 1/2 hour wait time phone help offers to “send your case to a specialist” -now 2 times and still no specialist has contacted.  The fact that they are FinCen means nothing. Only that the US gov’t can no longer shut them down like similar scam sites.  Do not be fooled by their apparent quality service.  The fees are ridiculous and the service is designed to wear you down. Make a paper wallet and keep your private keys. Don't learn the hard way like I did.

Also, in order to pay taxes on crypto with this app, you have to pay for a membership to access tax documents. In addition, you can’t withdraw money until your payments clear, which takes at least a week in my experience. This app is truly frustrating for investing. I did get some crypto from doing their earn tab though. This part was cool. As far as adding real money to invest with, this app is very annoying."

This is fishy and they leave no other options or ways to understand what is happening.

On top of the high commissions I tried to receive my new user incentive, which was met with endless loops without the incentive.

The bank account linked to my account has my name on it and I have statements from that account that I sent them. But somehow I cannot get my money back. 

After a couple weeks of them saying I should be able to get in but sending me generic FAQ messages they started repeating their messages and have not dealt with the glitch in their app. It has been a circle of waiting to talk to someone, explaining what is wrong again, then trying the same trouble shooting that all of them make me do, then they get a manager that says he will fix it by tomorrow then I wait 2 days and I still can’t access my account so I call back and start over.

Not to mention it has been over 24 hours since I’ve received my email saying that my ID was verified for a $5 Bitcoin reward as well and I still don’t have that showing in my account. Please fix this. I was very excited about the reward system part of the app but so far it’s a huge let down."
coinbase,ios,Dice Daddy,1,2021-04-11 18:48:20,"COinbase is a total rip off. When you sell or buy, your settled cash after the transaction is always far less than your fee deduction is supposed to be. You wonder where the extra cash ends up going? You’d think the fluctuations on coin price would sometimes go in your favor, if hypothetically this was the reason, but nope. Every time you sell or buy, your fee total is deducted plus extra money.

I decided okay, I’ll just transfer from one crypto to another when I want to exit a trade. There are 0$ commission fees for that. I go this route and $50 dollar change in price from one coin to another! No fees, but less capital for me. Where does that money go? 

I decided no thank you. I’ll find another platform, maybe even Robinhood because this is a RIP OFF!"

Its easy to use, easy to understand. It just makes this crypto space feel like the norm and as we all know crypto hasn't even poked its face into the public yet! At this point its worthless compared to what its going to be in a few years and coinbase helps you get that foot in the door! I love cryptocurrency and I love coinbase for making this new complicated space feel so easy and natural! Keep up all that you do!! Thank you!"

Then I bought coins 
Then I was trying to sell my coins I could not sub my coins close my ID was not verified so I went ahead and verify my ID 11 different times and each time my ID was updated in the system but when I try to withdraw my money it would say my ID is not verified and there is no customer service does not support team that can help you no one can help you with your money is completely gone 
I do not recommend anybody to use this app this is ridiculous they put a phone number on the on the website but no one is there to answer your phone no one is here to help you you are stock you are screwed your money was taken away from you and no one can help you"

I pay 39 dollar a month for unlimited trades and have found Coinbase flawless with withdraws and draws..

Then when add debit card Coinbase charged card almost $3 I was to enter amounts charged to verify card but app was bugged and not let me enter amounts. So I had to again from pc so card got charged almost $3 again. They say it’s temporary but to me it’s as if someone took money from me without asking and then say I’ll pay it back later. On top of this I tried to buy crypto where it took money immediately but says I have to wait 2 weeks for it to be available. That is not ok. I don’t see how anyone would be ok with waiting 2 weeks for bc purchases.

I finally got in contact with a chat agent and all they did was tell me the basic troubleshooting steps (sign in/sign out, refresh the app,etc.) my biggest issue with coinbase is there customer support they need to have a number where customers can call I had to go through all these loops to be able to find a number and talk to someone."

I haven’t been able to send any of my Bitcoin purchase to an outside wallet and every time I try to cash out my funds the app suddenly tells me I have none. There is no real person associate that is available to discuss any technical issues with through their chat box and I’m still waiting on a response back from two separate help tickets that I sent out regarding this issue. My advice is for anyone else out there to seriously reconsider using this app for any crypto purchase and trading.

When I began searching around it shows more funds on hold than I have in my account and it goes up and down, almost like they are using the crypto you’ve purchased to pay other people who are buying crypto.

What I seek is clarity on 2 things via their ux... 1) can we get a clearer understanding of what the underlying purchase and the growth or lack there of is.... 2) can you explain your fees as some may be averaging in to these over time. Taking 2% on 100 is fine but you actually rake 2 on 50... can you clearly state, as we buy hold and sell this asset/currency/whatever. We need to know that because we pay you, you hold our fractional and you offer us liquidity and use.  These rates are onerous. This could be a currency or an asset, but I care how you treat us.

After loading the app I find that you cannot do a single thing until you have turned over enough of your personal information that someone could apply for a mortgage in your name. I can’t believe people do this with a company they know nothing about, let alone what their privacy protections are. Please understand that I am not accusing them of any malfeasance, just really bad judgement. I totally understand the government mandates, but at least save the data collection for when the Bitcoin actually changes hands for the first time."
coinbase,ios,Dee9083554,2,2021-02-08 13:26:44,It's easy to use but very limited in terms of coins you are allowed to buy. If you are starting out with $500 the fees will take up all your profits so it's extremely hard to make money. For example I bought several coins and my portfolio was up $75 I sold all of my position so I could buy everything back on the dip. After selling everything I had a $9 profit because the fees to sell are high. So you if you start out with a small amount do not expect to keep the profit you money generates in a diversified portfolio. You will have to put all of your money in one coin to avoid the fees.  Kraken is hard to make deposits but you can buy any coin you want and the fees are next to nothing. .
coinbase,ios,Truth that hurts,1,2018-07-21 19:03:55,"When you finally had enough and want to sale everything you have on the app their is a few problems. 
1. You can’t sale the Max because of its programming. So you can only sale at max 1/2 of what you have.
2. Their is a charge fee to take what you bought. Depending on how much you had invested. even if you want to take 1 dollar out there is a .99 cent fee to take it out. 

Worst investment I have ever made. You want to invest into something worth your time. Read a people skills book so you can get ahead of the pack. communication is a lost art and people are super sensitive to good people skills because Majority of people today lack the ability to hold a solid conversation. based on the programming they get from social media and the things they follow."

I love that they added alerts to litecoin and everything runs way more smoothly. The fees are a little high and transferring funds to a bank account will cost about $10 per transfer. Don’t expect to play the market with an app like this. You won’t make anything trying to sell high and buy low. The fees make sure of that."
coinbase,ios,Rhi Pard,3,2018-03-05 15:55:14,"They've made it pretty easy to buy & sell. Only challenge is when you wanna link a debit card for quicker & easier transaction & coinbase system doesn't appear to have the capability yet to confirm and verify the amount of charges they post to your account. In my case they posted three transactions instead of two but only wanted me to verify two. However their system couldn't recognize any set of two out of the three they posted & it ended up locking me out of the system.

I wish they would add more coins. There was a litecoin fork sometimes back and I've held it for quite some time but never got any litecoin cash coins."

Investing is not something you can afford to wait on or mess around with.

Also, it sometimes asks for the passcode repeatedly, sometimes three times in a row.

They probably should have started with this instead of continuously asking me to come back. Agents will use any tactic to get to the next ticket and don’t care about wasting your time to get there. Coinbase system goes down during busiest important times and their customer service is really bad and don’t know the product. Overall, you’re better off using another app."
coinbase,ios,Grif1123,5,2024-01-12 21:24:46,"- Happy Customer of Coinbase since 2017

- Convenience Unmatched by other exchanges 

- Fee concerns: Use Advanced Trade for lower fees with maker-only limit orders

- Coinbase debit card: Functions as a reward debit card. Try linking to PayPal for bill payments that typically wouldn’t be eligible to gain credit card rewards.

- USD earns 5.1% interest

- Coinbase Wallet recommended for beginners until a hardware wallet is acquired (Coinbase mobile wallet may in the future offer hardware wallet support but desktop extension already does I believe).

- Learning program for rewards: Short tasks and quizzes give rewards

- On-ramping to crypto made easier with fee conversion to and from USD<->USDC -Coinbase integrations with layer two, base network, etc.

- Free withdrawals to the base network currently offered by Coinbase

- Opening a Coinbase account suggested as the first step in the crypto journey

Good luck!"

You also don’t have many tools as far as your actual gains and losses other than a single graph showing how much you’ve invested. So- that graph goes up if you add balance, but you can’t tell how much of each or any coin is gaining or losing. They post a gainers/losers on the front page- but that percentage isn’t really live, it’s a good way to FOMO yourself into losing money (once it’s on the front page that rally is usually over and you are buying at the top- especially with altcoins)"

Trades were either not made at all, and would show me an error screen after I placed the order; or would actually BE PLACED - and just SAY that they weren’t placed, resulting in one double buy and one TRIPLE BUY; and the WORST of all, was an INCORRECT DOUBLE BUY on some crap token that I never heard of (which caused me to miss out on the purchase of a token that I WANTED, and has since rocketed).

Each time I got the same lame error message after I tried to send the trade.
Even their email from customer service had that same error message.
Cost me $3300 in funds that I didn’t want to mess around with - not to mention ALL OF THEIR EXTRA FEES!

Yeah.

I also have thousands of XRP locked in the Coinbase Wallet, and I cannot transfer it anywhere. I cannot even transfer it back to my normal Coinbase Account.

I tried weeks to contact them to correct an issue I was having with my account and got nothing; not even a response (besides the automatic response). I the get a message that if I do not provide funds, they will cash out my crypto holdings. I could not deposit funds to account because they no longer allowed me to deposit funds from my bank account, which I was trying fro two weeks to get them to reinstate my bank account. They ended up cashing out my crypto and moved my funds from Coinbase Pro to Coinbase without my permission and I still do not have an answer to the reason for it. In all, awful experience."
coinbase,ios,Bandy!!!!!,4,2020-01-10 21:02:05,"Coinbase has an above average format that makes it easy to use and understand. I would like to see them adjust the home screen to make it easy to move crypto you are watching up and down the page. Also, after favoriting 50 coins, any doing after that does not show on the homepage correctly. For instance, if you have 50 coins favorited already and you then favorite Tron, the 51st coin on your list instead shows a repeat of one on your list of 50 (ex. Litecoin) but if you click on it it will then go to trons charts. Very inconvenient"

I’ve been a Coinbase customer for 3 years now and HAVENT been able to access my account. Talking to them is impossible, you have to go by email which takes days for them to ask you a stupid question they could answer which isn’t even the problem I’m trying to fix!!! I don’t know why they have a phone number bc no one can talk to you and it hangs up. To me this entire thing seems like a scam so far. I wouldn’t use this app and wouldn’t recommend it to anyone. If i can give you guys 0 stars i would. Very unhappy"

My recommendation is to avoid the authenicator apps because it had given me problems. when I lost or broke my phone. 

Coinbase was great about contacting it's users about the Bitcoin fork. I recieved Bitcoin cash sometime after and I didnt have to hassle for it."

I got an offer to try Coinbase thru Inbox Dollars.

Ridiculous, those funds have been settled for a week, and I'm waiting because your app wasn't working four days ago. Overall, I'm uninstalling the app once my money finally shows up. There are cheaper ways to invest in crypto if you really want to."

It’s very misleading and I don’t feel it’s a good product.   It’s kind of a rip off.   I tested him side-by-side and spread cost $50 on 1000 sometimes.  It’s terrible.

I need X amount of Ethirum to complete transaction, so I buy it, then all of a sudden balance isn’t available… but when I am buying crypto let me tell you it’s the exact opposite. Everything is available in less than 1 min. Coincidence, huh, I think not… smh. Crypto will never be fully accepted as nothing more than a risky investment because that’s all it is. Coinbase is leading that charge in the US!"

- Second point / issue I have , coinbase does not allow staking on the more blue chip Crytpos, etc BTC,ETH,SOL… and so on, and the loan ratio on Bitcoin is too much in favor of coinbase and a high fee (8%) 
But great work to you and your team. Hopefully you will come down on the fees and offer the higher interest / staking opportunity in more cryptos!!!"

They hide fees everywhere, specify an amount you will receive back by using their debit card and then after promising a set rate for a month 3 days later they drop it to 1% AFTER you payed the 4% fee to purchase. I’ve dealt with this kind of service for over 2 years, 20+ tickets sent in and 4-5 dummies over the phone and am now up to 3 issues I need assistance with but cannot get it.

Numbers are all over the place and it’s definitely NOT in the consumers favor as a couple hundred at a time seems to be robbed from every single transaction.

The app is good so far, I would say this is the best crypto market exchange for the US market nowadays. I do use all coinbase product: blue, pro and wallet. With the recent blue app updates, in order to see all the crypto watchlist, users should hit the “See all” button, and as a tech guy, I would say that it’s not a user friendly at all; therefore here’s my suggestion — please return back the previous watchlist into the main page, just remove that “see all” button. Thanks."

The is a few things I like to see. It'll be good to add a feature on the portfolio tap that will say how much money they gain or loss instead of just percentage.

Another thing is the notification for price change seem to only work for ETH and BTC. like to see that for other crypto"

No money ever went into my PayPal account, but I did get a notice that someone tried to log into my PayPal soon after. To make it worse, there are no instructions to explain just how this app works and I cannot seem to find any record to see just how this happened.

I would rather spend money on an app that doesn’t have any fees when buying or moving coin. I don’t need an app that takes %4 of my Ethereum or Bitcoin every time I make a transaction with Binance.

I couldn't continue my journey with crypto. But now I am back. I wanted to continue my journey but Coinbase stopped me. I have logged in but can't continue to use it because I have prove myself that I am the owner and there's only 2 way I can verify myself. Passport and driving licence. where's NID option? I opened my account with NID but now it disappeared.NEED HELP.

They have my Passport, drivers licence, utility bills, bank statements for the past year and still they send threatening emails to freeze my account in 15 days unless I give another set of 3 months statements. I wrote a formal complaint and it was closed as 'Resolved' because they sent me a link to their KYC conditions. That didn't answer my issue! And I didn't read about doing it every 3 months!"

coinbase,android,Sevki Torlak,1,2025-04-04 21:52:49,many of their 5 star reviews are coming from 3rd party paid review companies. coinbase is a greedy vampire that always find a way to hit you with a fee. I withdraw $265 to my regular CHECKING ACCOUNT which wasn't instantly option and they charged me a $28 fee. now coinbase charges a lot of other fees that other crypto wallets don't. i am a coinbase customer for 8 years and coinbase is changed a lot. they hold funds illegally for no reason. holding funds mean they make interest on our money. scam

coinbase,android,D. Perry,5,2025-04-02 04:25:01,"Nice update! Fixed a lot of buggy issues for me. Coinbase is the best CEX. Its one of the only exchanges that shows your average cost for each crypto asset, wich is invaluable when dca'ing and just in general. With Kraken and others you have to do maths everytime you purchase more of the same crypto to find your average cost. Safe to say its the best crypto app for everyone, first timers especially. Thank You Coinbase for a great trading experience."

Also, the Stop Limit function seems to be broken as it executes the trade at the stop price and not my limit price I set. Edit: Changed to 3 stars.

coinbase,android,Brandon W,1,2025-03-20 19:52:22,HPRRIBLE SERVICE! TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE BEWARE! They will take your money and hold/lock it up for however long they want. When depositing your money to coinbase expect to not be able to send it back to your bank or send it off exchange for months. Coinbase is very abusive towards their users. Avoid at all costs!

You have to verify your identity to do anything. And no matter what document I show and how I take those pictures and with what lighting - nothing works. The most infuriating in all this stupidity is that support just keeps wasting your time, doing nothing.

Today I realized that they also updated the terms of service sometime within the last week when I couldn't make my weekly debit deposit due to my debit limit being maxed out. I only deposited $75 last Wednesday. I was eventually allowed to deposit $25. be ready for slow order submissions and the $10 wire transfer fee if you actually have money to invest into crypto."
coinbase,android,Zack Smith,2,2025-03-19 23:45:10,"Set up was slow and frustrating. It had me verify my ID twice within a week of having the app, adding money was easy got invested all was well then my card was blocked permanently with no way to reverse it. All of this despite never having a transaction fail, never having a hiccup. Coinbase however had multiple, in a week time. I needed to withdrawl my funds which in itself was difficult due to you know my card being blocked. In short I'm back on Robinhood seeing as there service has competence."

coinbase,android,demarcus carmichael,5,2025-03-17 07:02:24,coinbase has vastly more support and functionality than the rest of the crypto brokers also with enhanced security. I never have to worry about my crypto being stolen and can sleep safe at night knowing coinbase is there
coinbase,android,Michael Grigson,1,2025-03-17 06:53:08,it's actually false advertising they won't give you the sign up bonus and the spin the wheel feature is intermittent depending on how the customer service rep feels at the time their are lots of restrictions on taking money out and moving your crypto to other platforms.. also brokerage fees are extortionate.. my advise try coin spot not coinbase

coinbase,android,Md Kawsar Hussen,2,2025-03-17 04:17:37,"The recent software update has introduced a display anomaly in the advanced chart view, necessitating a manual refresh to reinstate the default zoom level. To replicate this issue: log in to the advanced view, select any asset, choose a 6-hour or 1-day timeframe, then select a different asset. Two excessively large bars will display at a significantly zoomed-in level. Selecting the reset button will revert to the standard view; however, selecting another asset will reproduce the error."

coinbase,android,james tizedes,5,2025-03-17 01:24:11,Great trading platform... Needs to be easier to make profitable trades. We should get bonus coins for each trade rather than be penalized
coinbase,android,Marty Smith,4,2025-03-17 00:58:19,Has been a great journey. I appreciate the University Lessons that gives knowledge and crypto. Thank you. They need to develop a Coinbase Mobile wallet for private ownership of your assets. A Tantrum like device ....my humble opinion!
coinbase,android,FlapTickler 1,1,2025-03-17 00:55:15,Scam. They will let you add money to the account but then say you have an invalid payment method when trying to withdraw your money. Talked to customer service and they were no help I ended up having to do a wire transfer and lose out on more money. Never will I use this platform again and I implore anyone reading this to avoid it as well.

coinbase,android,Captain Matthew Morgan,1,2025-03-16 21:53:46,"I do not recommend. I just tried to buy $100 worth of bitcoin. Coinbase told me the bitcoin price was $82,000+ and some change. When I purchased $100 worth, instead of coinbase giving it to me at the price it was selling at, it add $1000 to the bitcoin price. So what I ended up with was alot less. Then on top of that, coinbase charged me 4 dollars to buy it. In the end, unless you hold out and buy low and sell big, the only winners in this corner is coinbase. Thank about that."

Coinbase is at the forefront of cultivating responsible regulation and therefore is the least likely platform to shut down and steal your funds. Don't keep all your eggs on any centralized exchange. Likewise, don't keep all your eggs on a Ledger either because all you know about either method is what you've been told."

Imagine you bought crypto and you want to make a quick transfer and it is held for 7days, and the most annoying part is they wrote the buying of the particular crypto is instantly, if it is instantly why do you hold it for transfer and also even collect transactions fee. This are the small but very annoying problem that makes the app usable. I switched to coinbase for the speed never imagined i would face this on my first try."

The amount of checks you have to go through it to use this has become ridiculous. If you are looking for a place to start it's ok, but I would not recommend this if not for just basic stuff.

kraken,ios,TonyB2011,5,2023-07-27 21:44:54,"App is always up. Doesn’t try to force Authenticator apps on me like uphold did and none of which worked. Processes transactions lightning quick. Withdrawals to cold wallet work fine. App has never once crashed on me. Wire transfer deposits credit same day while Uphold makes me wait 4 days. Some have said difficult to withdraw but I’ve only been slowly accumulating via DCA so I cannot speak to that. I’m happy with Kraken. Together with uphold is has the easiest to use interface for searching, reading price graphs and executing trades. 

Two small suggestions for future upgrade: (1) uphold tabulates and shows average cost or any price paid to date for each crypto balance when you click on your individual holdings. It’s a nice feature to have on red candle days when you want to see your average cost. (2) would be nice if allowed a memo to be added to the trade. Uphold has this on a preview trade screen before you click to confirm.  I like to have a reference I can type in on a transaction like “bought addit $100 of XXX on 5.4% dip to 0.45 avg cost 0.48.”"
kraken,ios,SupremeIlluminati999666,5,2024-10-12 08:29:29,I have to say I am very glad I didn’t give up on them in the beginning and stuck around bc they have had to work out some things but what is nice is they actually fix things and care about the customers ease of use but also the security measures I believe now in place are perfect! Not to much once you know what to expect or how to do it! I love having to verify every btc address by email but then they are save with no limits on just a few! This part was well thought out bc if you had to wait and could only verify three or something! Then wait another 24 hours ppl wouldn’t use it! I have noticed cash app mostly but for some strange reason if sent to an older stored address it still works but slower! If you check cash app before sending it will provide you a different address every few days! My favorite part is the converting to cash and send to your regular bank account is priceless at times! The one thing that would make this the best app and would be all I needed! If we had a debit card we could use for our account
kraken,ios,you scammed me five bucks,5,2024-04-19 21:30:22,"I had some pretty extensive problems that I mostly created on my Kraken account. I would rate them at a 7+ it took me about two days to explain all of the problems that I was experiencing once they understood everything I would say it took an additional 2 to 3 days so that is a total of five days or so that may seem like a lot, but I had really made things difficult for them. They were solid and complete in fixing all of these problems. You get onto the app and start funding your crypto it is very easy if you are using debit card, credit card bank wire transfer I like the direct deposit from my checking account using their ACH Plaid I can’t say enough about how well there associates helped me and how well their platform works! I love it I wouldn’t use anything else. Thank you Bill."

I am very grateful for your dedication to making things, righ1 I’ve had nothing but successful Kraken you guys are taping my book and I promote you in that way everyone I know regarding crypto.

kraken,ios,Bicyclyboy,5,2024-03-13 13:58:41,"The whole world of crypto is super confusing to me. I don’t have the foggiest clue, except that I have tried several different platforms, including LOBSTRWallet, and Coinbase. And some really stupid thing called moon pay 

I really hate the crypto world, because nothing ever seems to really work. It seems like it’s a whole bunch of fraud. I try to make transactions and waste a whole lot of my time and the transaction doesn’t go through. It’s incredibly frustrating. I absolutely hate crypto because of how stupid it is and how Difficult it is to try to figure out and there are no directions for anything. I would rather pull my teeth out, then have to interact with the world of crypto, but seems like things are a little better here on Kraken. Kraken seems to be the real deal."
kraken,ios,Cjudyofficial,1,2023-05-21 18:03:09,"I implore everyone to stay of this useless and criminal company called Kraken. Once you receive BTC, they will put your account on hold and next thing is, they will write you a message that your account have be closed. They’re so useless and poor customer service. No one should download this useless app.

Update to your response: 
Why on earth will you close someone account without giving the reason? Or do you think you’re the only company that deals with crypto. Since my journey in crypto world, no company have ever close my account and I’m surprise this Kraken did without reason. The only thing they will say is security reasons. Well, my candid advice to anyone who want to download your Kraken app, don’t ever use it, once you buy or receive crypto, they will close your account and send you a message that for security reason your account is closed and that’s is final. All your coins are gone. They have done it to almost all my colleague at work then we have to move back to Coinbase and enjoy peace of mind."

I reached out on the Support Center to chat with a specialist. All they do is put in a ticket and say someone will be getting back with you soon and no one ever did. So, I hop back on the Support Center to chat again and they can't help because there is already an open ticket. So, I get the run around for a week highly annoyed a frustrated not being able to access my funds. I eventually find Krakensupport on Reddit and they get the ticket prioritized and the issued resolved the next day after I gave them the information they needed to help me. I got my funds and purchased what I wanted and then transferred my crypto to my cold storage wallet and got my stuff off of Kraken due to the bad experience. Moral of the story the Kraken Support Center is a complete joke, kraken is kind of shady too."
kraken,ios,nms11x,5,2024-03-31 10:42:37,"Thanks a lot for a great app & customer service team! I’m new to BTC (and all crypto). But I wanted it to buy goods from a website to get a perpetual 25% off. I had no clue what I was doing. But I started checking out apps etc. I installed then deleted a bunch w/o using them b/c the fees were insane, confusing, and/or dynamic (including CoinBase, Binance, and some instant crypto site a Redditor posted). Then I found Kraken. The fees were so much lower. 

I couldn’t figure out how to send funds to someone to pay for my orders on their site. So I sent a ticket to customer support. A REAL HUMAN replied within a minute! They sent me a list of steps. You need to log in the Kraken website to do it. It was simple to do following the few steps.

FYI: Transfer USD to the app then buy your Bitcoin (or the other crypto that you want). For some reason, the app wouldn’t let me buy BTC directly from my bank. But I realized i could load USD into the app then buy the crypto (so 2 steps instead of 1). Only takes an extra 15 seconds lol.

The graphs are great as well. It would be cool if they added a calculator for profit based on hypothetical crypto prices and/or past dates to buy & sell."
kraken,ios,itsoyydoyfyocyofyo,5,2021-12-27 22:23:23,"I like my desktop a little bit better, but Kraken has been the most user-friendly and quick to respond exchange, especially since I started bringing larger amounts of fiat on. Other centralized exchanges I have had issues with wires coming through. To me steps in the process, but crack and makes it easy! Definitely recommend for anybody getting into crypto or people have been around for a few years, there is some thing for everybody from beginner to pro. Plus there the first crypto exchange to get a actual bank charter, in Wyoming! Have a feeling Wyoming is going to be leading the charge in cryptocurrency considering their regulatory environment and senators that they have sitting and their opinions on crypto. Let’s charge!"

The only other things I would sayI love how they have the prices so easy to see a list by market cap as of it was cmc or count geicko though I don’t know y a new tab mush open up only for that. Also, and not a single exchange does this well but kraken has gotten we with showing what networks are supported by each token for deposits and withdrawals. It just be so obvious even b4 purchasing.

I would sign up with different platforms and try to understand it but I just couldn’t but when I registered for an account with Kraken everything changed and my mind did about five 360’s and exploring the app and getting familiar with it everything just started to make sense! I have every crypto app there is but the ONLY ONE I buy, sell, trade and have anything to do with is Kraken and to each its own but Kraken is the BEST platform there is to me personally and they have the best most friendly and courteous support who will go above and beyond to assist you with anything you need! I very highly recommend Kraken  to everyone!"

They said I am able to withdraw my money, but I have tried multiple times. This is just disappointing all because I hit the maximum card attempts. They want to shut my account down and so basically they are keeping my money. This is disappointing :/"
kraken,ios,TanksMaster,1,2024-12-04 11:14:43,"Very Concerning App. Everyone should be aware that Kraken can lock your account and simply not respond for days as to why or how to fix it. I reached out 2 weeks ago about my locked account. After a couple days they gave instructions that I completed and still nothing. My account is still locked. Idk if that’s similar to other crypto apps but it’s been very frustrating not being able to manage MY money. The best part is the app had no issue with me depositing money, that part’s not locked. What is locked is withdrawing, buying, selling, anything else. Once I’m finally able to get my money out of this app, I will never use it again. Horrible HORRIBLE service. Almost shameful.

Update: I read a similar review to mine that kraken responded to. They basically said usually a decision to close a client account is final… how is possible they can just close your account and keep your money? This has to be illegal."
kraken,ios,Camm.stevens,5,2025-02-12 05:14:36,"The Kraken crypto app is a reliable and user-friendly platform for trading cryptocurrencies. Its intuitive interface makes it easy to navigate, whether you're a beginner or an experienced trader. The app offers robust security features, including two-factor authentication and advanced encryption, ensuring your funds and personal information are well-protected. It supports a wide range of cryptocurrencies and provides detailed real-time market data, which is great for making informed trading decisions. Although it can experience occasional lag during high traffic periods and the fees can add up, overall, Kraken is a solid choice for anyone looking to trade cryptocurrencies."

These ridiculous people will randomly close your account and tell you that due to “policy” they can’t tell you why your account is being closed. Not to mention they will also close your account WHILE YOU ACTIVELY HAVE MONEY / CRYPTO POSITIONS STILL OPEN. These people are scammers and a headache waiting to happen, do yourself a favor STAY AWAY FROM THIS GARBAGE BROKER. The worst part is, when they close your account, after emailing them 100 times, they will finally open up your account so you can finally get YOUR money back, but even then if you try to send your crypto to a different wallet they will literally CANCEL the transaction every single time, and they try to force you to close your positions and only withdraw to your bank account, this is straight up fraudulent. I cannot give this app any compliments, there is nothing good to say, all bad. Do yourself the favor and STAY AWAY FROM KRAKEN."
kraken,ios,Marshall0Banana,1,2025-02-18 12:07:24,"This app lacks so many basic features that are essential to crypto trading, that it makes the entire platform obsolete. I 100% REGRET trusting Kraken with my bank details & funds. Coinbase offers much more. More details, info, and ease of access. Kraken does their very best to prevent you from withdrawing your winnings/profits, and to keep you using their sorry excuse of “streamline and simple UI”, even the charts have minimal data and are if anything detrimental to the user due to the lack of accessible information. If you are thinking of downloading this app, first look into a private crypto wallet, and then if thats not for you look at coinbase. I personally give this app 1/5 stars, if i could give it leas i would. Piss-poor UI, God-awful charts and information display, Genuinely despicable app. waste of storage, time, brainpower, & everything in between. Hope the devs can straighten it up someday."

When I asked it a question about a withdrawal, I received a canned response, but then I mentioned that it did not apply to my situation and Kai was able to correct the previous answer with perfectly accurate information. I never received a response like “I don’t know the answer” and was never provided with a list of topics that didn’t apply to me (with other AI support tools, I frequently get a list of options that aren’t relevant to my situation or needs!). I am thoroughly impressed by Kai, Kraken’s Ai support and I  recommend using the platform."

The app looks great and functions just like it should.  To my knowledge they have never been hacked and the only time user funds have been affected was due to users, in fact I have even seen some instances where Kraken gave people their crypto back, which I agree with if it was not the users fault.  But the cases I read it was the fault of the person, which I don’t.  Overall the app is great for new and expert users and I do most of my business with them.  Now if we could get a government and SEC that was friendly to crypto my life would be complete!"

kraken,ios,5parky:::,1,2025-01-14 05:47:31,"Somehow my account got overdrawn by about $20. I’m not sure why but, it happened. Well I transfer roughly $2,500 of bitcoin over to Kraken to cover the $20 negative balance that I had and also do a little trading. Well, since my account had gotten overdrawn, the deposit “required manual approval” before funds would be available. This manual approval took 3 days. I’m now on day 3 of the deposit being approved and I still can’t do anything with it. So, on day 6 of transferring the LTC to Kraken, I can’t do anything with it. 

When I call, I get no answer. When I chat, nobody responds. When I reply to the automated email, I get no response. I understand the manual approval for the account being overdrawn, but it shouldn’t take 3 days. And now why am I still not able to do anything with it on day 6. This is ridiculous. I guess I’m just out $2,500."

Coinbase has you wait 2-3 days every single deposit which if you arr trying to add or hop into a position quickly that will be completely impossible to do with coinbase but with kraken u actually have a chance.

My experience is consistent with what others have detailed in their negative reviews. Kraken made me jump through all kinds of hoops to open an an account. I ran a couple trades through it to test it out then let the assets sit there for a while. When I wanted to resume my activity they allowed a funds transfer IN, but placed in on hold without any sort of warning. A week later I inquired about the hold and was notified that they would initiate a transfer back, that I had to empty the account and my account would be canceled. No  explanation of any kind.  

I still have not received the transfer back and guess what happened when I initiated a withdrawal for the remaining funds? They placed THAT transaction on hold. Idiotic."

Instead of helping me solve the top up problem, they deactivated all my payment and withdrawal methods, claiming that there is a security risk!!! Really?! Never saw anything like that, seriously. Good thing I never added any money to this horrible app. I am deleting it right now and forgetting forever. I am not the one to write reviews (lack of time) but I felt it us my duty to warn future customers and spread the word of this horrible treatment of clients, unacceptable in the 21st century!"

The charts, history and other information are very much needed. However, still including the simplistic press two buttons and you have crypto. One thing that Binance couldn’t offer is UX. I’m a huge fan of full control but I do like my click click crypto too. So to make that happen I do have to keep swapping back and forth to ensure information is correct. I fully recommend using Kraken over Binance. Thanks for all your hard work!  I can’t wait to see what coins are available next."

What’s popular and new. The pie chart shows what is being diversified, especially if some coins are being staked. Which brings me to my big question and wishing. Will you be able to input staking inside the app, instead of going on your website to do so. It just be SOOOO much more convenient, I just keep forgetting to stake the coins I buy, just due to the fact I have to login to my computer, login and do all those steps.

Then I get a nasty email from the company saying my account will be closed without any explanation. Then they threaten me with closing my account within 72 hours and tell me I have to pay about another $30 to get my money that sitting in my account for days since they refused to release the funds and told me they’ll take all my money in 72 hours.

Then they say the first transaction of any kind there’s a 72 hour hold. That’s a lie, every time you buy crypto there’s a 72 hour hold, which means you loose out on trades etc. they take your money within seconds, but you can’t withdraw that money for 7 days, You can’t sell  either. Thieves. They also have the most fees for everything and they’re not cheap. Don’t bother calling, you won’t get an answer, no one has spoken to them. Their “24/7” live service is just bots, who copy and paste from the app and Google. Trash app. Definitely not American friendly, avoid

If there is an error, they assume you’re stupid and only show “transaction error” but don’t give any clue. You must depend on support. Support is chat only and with a bot that spans you with support articles. The app doesn’t give a notification if it’s closed so you play tag. If there really is a human, they don’t really work. They just try to close tickets. After a week I figured out my transaction was failing from an iOS bug in their app. QA testing?? After installing the new version, no transaction issue. Support was a total failure and I figured it out on my own after dealing with my bank. You’re in big trouble if you need support. Beware."

Totally frozen and unavailable to use. Real nice. 
Contact support (good luck) for some worthless bot interaction and get nowhere. Get a real rep and your issue will escalate to ‘email support’. The email support is that they’re closing your account. Don’t even waste your time or resources. Several people have had the exact same experience as me.

After it put the order through, I reviewed it to make sure that everything was correct, NOPE I was wrong, instead of putting my buy order in at the ask price I wanted, the price that was put through was $82. Now mind you I thought it just boomed up and had a huge spike so I login into other exchanges and public charts that have almost live time price changes and not one single chart showed me it reached anywhere near $82. The most it raised to was $62. So where did the $20 plus extra per share come from? Am I missing something here?"

Kraken had us jump thru hoops writing a letter word for word, sign & date then having us hold it up so they could see our hands we had to do this 3 time. This would be fine but it’s not. This should be a scene on Saturday Night Live. Did they think someone had tied us up it’s laughable! But not so funny. After 2 days of trying to comply with their ridiculous request they abruptly informed us they were closing our accounts without ever opening, this company must have a lot to hide they’re  xtremely paranoid & act imbalanced. 
Run to Coinbase where they appreciate their customers and don’t act crazy. My opinion"

Not only do they pick up but their whole customer service department is so well-trained that they can fix 90% of any issue you have right there in the spot, you don’t have to get passed off to the next person, then the next person, then the next person like every other big company’s customer service department."

If your looking to start trading on kraken be aware that it’s gonna take weeks to get setup between the wait times for ID verification and the wait time they put on your deposits. I had to send a photo of my ID 4 times because they claimed they couldn’t read it clearly. They no longer offer leverage or margin trading in the US unless you have an account with $10million yes that’s right $10million dollars if you want to trade on margin or leverage. There’s way better options out there like BitStamp

If you ask me it’s a little too user friendly I love detail… like KuCoin had (although not user friendly for most). The fees that went with transferring wasn’t too big but still a bit annoying because I could’ve just bought it all here and never had to pay any fee. I would give it a 5 but it really needs to give more details on your position and just more info in general

kraken,ios,NYC_2020,1,2024-11-07 12:01:44,"I open the account to trade futures but found out that Futures trading is not available on Kraken.
So after funding my account using ACH deposit I wanted to get my money back. When trying to make a withdrawal, I was told there is a 7 days hold on my funds. If there was a warning or notification of a 7 days hold prior to making a deposit, I would never make a deposit. There was no warning. Kraken should clearly state this fact but Kraken is hiding this info in small print and its not visible when making a deposit.
Following up on developer reply: 
If your policy is 10 days hold on any new deposit or transfer, why don’t you place a warning in BOLD RED font, stating 
“You will not be able to make any withdrawal for 10 days”?
No placing this warning is a form of deception. You make it very easy to deposit new money,  but when it comes to withdrawing funds, you make it impossible. 
You are making a profit on my money that is being held on your platform so its no wonder that making withdrawals difficult is beneficial to Kraken but is it legal? I would not be surprised to see a class action lawsuit."

However, when I tried a larger transfer of a few hundred dollars, the transaction was suspended, and my account was suddenly flagged for closure without any explanation. Upon contacting support, I was informed that the account would be closed for “security reasons” with no further details provided. This abrupt action, despite me being a legal U.S. resident and providing all necessary IDs, reflects an unprofessional approach. Any security concerns should have been communicated transparently and proactively, not as an afterthought.

Update: Received a response from the developer explaining (like customer service) that for “security reasons” they cannot disclose the reason my account was closed. I am not sure what kind of “security” service Kraken is running that is able to confirm identify (after all those steps) and “open an account” for a user but can not disclose the security reason for “account closure” for the same user! This unidirectional logic is seriously flawed to my opinion. I’ve discouraged many in my circle of friend against using this app for this very reason."

There is no reason to avoid this feature unless it’s to keep users in the dark and that is very shady. The community has been asking for this for almost 3 years, and it still hasn’t been implemented.

This is not an investment platform at all or a place to hold anything off value (but it looks like one) 

I have made over 1000+ trade in 2024 

I will buy tokens when I need to pay a gas fee transferring my NFT’S to another wallet 

I buy tokens cheeper on days that i see the token prices are down to get a discount.

I only would hold for long term Bitcoin and I would only buy in under FINRA associated- NoT here as it’s FORF (in Florida)/ the risks of theft is/are to strong/ I trust the kraken team 100%

Today is June 1st, but when I go over to the 24 hr history of a specific crypto, it displays the overall trend since May 25th and no trend for today. Another thing that is strange is that I’ll hover over the trends with my finger all the way to the right just a tad bit before the current time (5:00 pm) and it displays May 26th, 4:45 am. This results in just seeing inaccurate changes in the trend."

The chat agent was rude, sent me only one message saying that they could not help and to email Kraken. This is ridiculous and I will never use this app again.

First, the deposit and trade sections are always displayed on the page, which is redundant and disrupts the user experience. Second, in the assets section, stablecoins and cryptocurrencies are grouped together, making it difficult to track my portfolio’s performance. Even worse, they have forcefully added “Explore” currencies, making the interface more cluttered and harder to navigate.

""_Frustrating Experience: Locked Out of Account for Over a Month with No Help in Sight_

I've been trying to sign in to my Kraken account for over a month, but the platform won't recognize my credentials. Despite trying every troubleshooting step, I'm still locked out.

What's even more disappointing is the lack of support from Kraken's team. It's incredibly difficult to find help or get a response to my tickets. The support resources are scarce, and the community forums are unhelpful.

I've tried:

- Resetting my password
- Enabling two-factor authentication
- Clearing browser cache
- Submitting multiple support tickets
- Searching community forums

Still, no solution or explanation. As a result, I'm unable to access my funds or trade. This is unacceptable for a cryptocurrency exchange that claims to prioritize security and user experience.

Until Kraken improves their support and account access issues, I strongly advise against using their platform."""

Kraken should have a better security in place to protect accounts. Total scam. Be careful. Kraken doesn’t protect your account. Not sure why people leave good reviews. Probably bots leave 5 stars to promote their illegal activities. If you don’t want to lose money don’t do business with Kraken.

Update: Kreken’s response is so unprofessional to say the least. Sorry for inconvenience? We are talking about $1000 here. Instead of saying sorry for inconvenience, try to help us return the money hackers or who knows who stole using your insecure platform. 

Again those 5 star reviews seems to me come from bots to allure more naive people to trust their money with your app. 

Lastly, when responding to good reviews you write their names and when responding to negative reviews you’re using Hi or Hello as if those who write truth don’t deserve to be called by their names. So pathetic."
kraken,ios,jj3557,3,2024-03-27 11:39:34,"Overall I like the app. But the “portfolio value” chart on the homepage is useless because it reflects % changes in your account balance from deposits and withdrawals, not just gains/losses. For example, when I fund my account it shows a several thousand percent gain. So the data provided is meaningless.

My other major issue came when I tried to transfer (withdraw) from Kraken to another wallet and it hasn’t gone through even a week later.

Lastly, you can’t trade every coin they show so what’s the point really?"

Overall I am very satisfied with your exchanges, everything is easy to use, user friendly, very reasonable fees services. The only thing that I like to suggest to your exchange is that can Kraken do the annual tax report (tax statements) for clients? Make it ready available (already calculated for clients) and covenant for clients just like Coinbase did it for their clients.  If Krakens can do this then there is nothing more that I think Krakens lacking, and I will give your exchange 5 stars! 😁

I will be cashing out as soon as 72 hours are up and closing my account as their support stated this is a permanent change. You cant expect your users to just be ok with a change without notifying them. Thats just wrong and impactful to your users. I will also be closing my account once my funds are transferred out.
kraken,ios,SoloBalina,5,2025-01-17 22:31:29,Kraken won’t lock your money up like Coinbase and Kraken lets you freely send money after a few weeks after your funds settle. Coinbase will hold your funds on exchange for 6 months. Kraken is very secure just set all your security features to the highest level of security and you should be have a great experience on ramping and managing your funds with Kraken!
kraken,ios,t4lj,1,2022-02-19 13:11:01,I had issues logging on with another device. Talk to customer support about it and got it fixed. Immediately after that they froze my account. Now they have me jumping through hoops so I can access my funds. They want a picture of me holding my ID with a hand written note. Also have to answer questions. When I first signed up and spent a couple thousand dollars they weren’t that worried about security. If you buy crypto from them immediately move it to your own private wallet. Terrible customer service.
kraken,ios,Turbo8889,5,2024-11-23 09:56:34,"I’ve been with Kraken since 2021 and when I first opened an account, it wasn’t that great. It was very difficult to maneuver but now going into Kraken I’m truly enjoying it a lot you guys have really made a lot of great updates it’s easy to understand and easy to maneuver and I can’t wait to continue using Kraken. Thank you!"
kraken,ios,SL1ppin,5,2024-08-24 02:10:09,I was having difficulties getting started with the app and contacted customer service and was actually able to speak with a real person that I was able to understand!

A couple days later I get another email saying my account will be getting closed due to security purposes? Makes no sense. They also followed up on the email saying I need to deposit my money before my account closes but how can I do that when my money is on hold? This is wrong I’ve seen multiple people go through the same thing, might have to reach out to a lawyer this is unbelievable."
kraken,ios,SEBrokaw,5,2024-12-13 14:01:04,"I use Kraken & another exchange for weekly BTC DCA purchases. I’ve opted to exclusively use Kraken for DCA as fees are less, the spreads are in line with other exchanges in my experience & the app interface is straight forward.  Note, I routinely move my purchases onto cold wallets so I’ve not considered either app for anything other than purchasing cryptocurrency."

Wow that was painful, and now it’s just pure joy to buy within seconds anywhere!!"

Kraken is very disappointing and disgusting, unfortunately I switched to Robin Hood app for better crypto experience.. it seems kraken is propelling for bankruptcy so they need to steal user’s funds for their own good..
Worst app ever coin base is by far the best platform which has no issues"
kraken,ios,7Brink7,1,2024-06-06 20:10:36,"Opened an account after quite a few hassles.  Tried to fund my acct via an ACH deposit and Kraken locked the funds up for 5 days.  Then I sent a federal Wire following their exact instructions and they closed my account and gave me 72 hours to withdraw my funds or I would lose them.   I don’t know what their issue was or is but I would steer clear of this horribly run organization.  

My checking account was with Chase for well over 6 years and I have never had an issue with any other brokerage account ever."

Definitely recommended and if you are starting with crypto a must!"
kraken,ios,Gator6375,5,2025-02-26 09:39:05,I honestly don’t know or understand much about what most of these crypto tokens represent or what they do beyond hold value.  Thanks to Kraken’s information at the bottom of each token or most of them I feel more comfortable and knowledgeable about the financial choices I’m making on this app.
kraken,ios,Roybel,3,2021-12-22 07:06:41,"The reason I give this app three stars is because it holds your coins for you, as in holds them hostage—you cannot transfer them to an exterior wallet. Otherwise I think it’s the best app out there and that is because of the features that you get with not being able to export your coins. You are able to trade freely with low low fees no gas between all the different platforms!"
kraken,ios,Jay Boudreaux,5,2025-01-04 15:19:18,A few flaws on price updates and trouble buying assets with cashapp. Easy bitcoin transfer and quick. Crashes sometimes but normal.

They tried to act like they give a crap by posting a response to this review. I contacted them again and got the same weak response. If they are closing my account for security purposes they need to tell me what those purposes are so that I am not compromised. It’s all garbage."
kraken,ios,Krakens newest fan,5,2024-12-01 07:05:17,Navy fed has straight up just glitched the majority of apps/wallets/exchanges I’ve tried to connect to. This took me 13 seconds to get my identity verified w/ drivers licence and then connect my bank (13 seconds is obviously hyperbole but seriously took ten minutes to get the crypto out of my Solflare wallet and convert to usd)
kraken,ios,c higs,5,2025-03-16 17:34:20,Great platform to buy and sell. Easier to navigate than uphold (I have uphold for certain tokens not available on ”Kraken” but I like Kraken more. I do wish they would reward their long term customers like Robinhood did with the five days of Christmas thing but overall Kraken is the best. Just ask Mr Portnoy!
kraken,ios,RaKingIZI,1,2024-07-16 13:03:46,I got scammed badly awhile ago i sent a bitcoin to a “investor” but it was a total scam and while i was angry i swore in a email at the customer service guy who said he could do nothing and deleted my account with other lower level cryptos still in it this is the worst company apart from coin base I’ve ever delt with P.S. to the customer service department that responded i dont have the case number emails anymore as this happened last year i know youll say its my fault and theres nothing you can do but thats lame like you said last time

Overall really good app. I would like to see either an alert system, so you can set a price target on crypto and when it reaches it you get notified. Or some sort of system so you could buy at a certain price. That would push it to 5 stars for me."
kraken,ios,Happy Man 1776,5,2025-03-06 20:49:54,"I love Kraken and have easily connected it to external wallets, used customer service, etc.  The process to buy, sell, transfer is fantastic and I feel safe using their platform.  I use 10+ platforms and like Robinhood as a secondary to Kraken.  Some say “coin block” is the way to go.  I disagree."

kraken,ios,Og.bratva,1,2024-03-08 00:20:22,"Extremely slow and mediocre customer service. Their deposit methods are a mess, they will credit your account without being able to debit your bank account . I try to make card purchase to pay the balance they were not able to take from my bank account but then they suspend me from doing that because they cannot debit your account at first. Then they tell you wire us this amount or liquidate your assets. Sounds like a trap to make money from fees they charge you."
kraken,ios,Co$$ack,1,2023-07-31 18:16:51,I’m US based with Intermediate verification level. These idiots froze my funds without warning and explanation when I attempted to make transactions within my account limits. Customer service is the worst with canned repeated replies that do not answer your questions. They will ask you for documents you cannot produce in reasonable time. It appears Kraken run by greedy crooks who think they own your money and can do anything they want with them as they feel like at any moment.
kraken,ios,Joe W. TX,4,2021-12-24 17:22:34,Has lower fees and the desktop app allows you to control a lot more information from historical crypto trades.

kraken,ios,Pirkalation,5,2025-01-29 03:51:52,"Want to speak to a real person when needing support? Kraken is that exchange! Very user friendly interface. You can’t ask for much more.

Thanks again. Enjoy your day."
kraken,ios,hansgroße👾,1,2023-04-01 14:26:01,I’m tired of being taken advantage of. This is my money and I need it now. There is no reason you should hold my money. Say someone gets ahold of my card and buys 5k in furniture. The purchase is done. I dispute it and move on. This shows bad trading practices and they are probably trading shares instantly with your money that you deposit that same day. They are happy to take your money and make it their own for 3 days until they can pay you back. I would look elsewhere unless you need something obscure like dash coin

I called customer service and they said they could not help me 
The support chat sometimes does not respond and now I’m being asked to take a picture with my Id and a handwritten document when I’ve been a verified member for over 4 years . It’s fishy now"
kraken,ios,uyyyyyyyyytttyyy,5,2024-10-01 15:21:10,Crazy deposit revenue evaluation in the sense of how the crypto market is pertaining to this bone. I think that everyone should be able on this app and invest as quickly as you can so that you can retain profits from your remaining dollar fraud currency currently right now that is losing value.

kraken,ios,Rodger.Padgett,1,2024-06-05 01:58:58,avoid this app like the plague it is. Customer support is next to none. They canceled my account forced me to convert my bitcoin to dollars and then transfer it to my bank account and then immediately charge my bank account $1200 more than I had to move out of their account what kind of app does that? What kind of company allows that to happen? If you close my account cancel all pending transactions. Very simple apparently not for you. People because you’re not very responsive.

This app is great and I suggest it to anyone and everyone who asks for a recommendation.
kraken,ios,4 /\/ 7,5,2022-01-11 15:16:10,They have made a lot of user-friendly improvements to the app that now make it better than the other options in my opinion. Buying with Apple Pay and converting one crypto to another being my top 2 improvements.

kraken,ios,D. John™,1,2024-01-20 03:04:00,Don’t use if you’re working w little money. ($20-$100) They take forever to withdrawal. Or just flat out don’t allow it. They have temporarily HELD my money for days like a US bank. Crypto is supposed to be fast and haggle free - this app doesn’t even have all assets in crypto. Much better just using trust wallet directly. And Uniswap( I never have issues on Uni ) and trust wallet let’s you buy just $1 if you felt like it. In crypto some assets for $10 will get you millions in crypto for the HODL. Game up kraken. Never using you again.
kraken,ios,Chuck 1587,5,2023-01-13 20:29:07,"Better than coinbase, this is a fantastic app for beginners.

Finally with this new app I can recommend Kraken to my friends and family who are just getting started with crypto."
kraken,ios,Peanut_King,5,2022-06-12 22:12:56,"Kraken is my favorite exchange because they carry KAVA, the best DeFi coin out there.

kraken,ios,Friar Faithful,3,2025-02-24 21:23:10,I chose Kraken after reading Reddit threads recommending it. The interface is clean and the app was easy to use. But it wasn’t until after I purchased XRP with it that I learned they took over 3% of my money off the top. Super disappointing and not transparent at all. If they do the same thing when I sell that’ll be 6% of my portfolio eaten up in fees. Likely won’t be using this again.

kraken,ios,AVINUI,5,2023-10-26 08:52:06,"The Kraken app and website are very user friendly.   It’s straightforward trading platform and I am able transfer funds to/from my bank accounts within seconds!

kraken,ios,placationstation,4,2022-09-23 15:04:01,"I like the UI and the collection of assets available for purchase. Would like some more features though! Also, the security feature where you are logged out after X amount of days of no use is a bit annoying, however practical."

kraken,ios,2ahfdit,1,2024-12-30 14:12:48,I’ve been using this app for about a month to store some less valuable crypto to move around. About two or three weeks ago I noticed some fraudulent charges on my account I did not make. Now almost all the features of my wallet are disabled and I can’t even move it somewhere safe. All because they can’t figure out why I was charged almost 50 bucks with no crypto to show for it. Do yourself a favor and skip using kraken.
kraken,ios,rspencer22,1,2023-10-13 00:33:39,"Took my money and holding it for 7 days even though it was deducted from my account the next day. If I had known, I would not have used them. They said there were notices about it but that was not obvious to me at all. NO pop-ups when depositing the money that said something along the lines of hey, you can deposit the money, but there will be a 7 day hold. Worst first experience with crypto…I’ll be getting my money out as soon as they release it."
kraken,ios,HamFam23,5,2024-03-17 22:34:28,"Kraken actually lets me transfer my own funds after the initial waiting period. It’s like I own my crypto or something!! 

Coinbase? They like to freeze my funds and delay my transactions as “suspicious” with no explanation and no accountability. Absolutely unacceptable."
kraken,ios,Kraken is awesome!!!,5,2023-12-07 05:27:30,Big variety of coins and tokens. plenty of networks to choose from. Plus they’ve been around since like 2012 and never failed. App is pretty easy to navigate and intuitive.  Thumbs up here 👍👍
kraken,ios,Zillifam,5,2021-12-08 01:52:48,I was an avid Coinbase user until….the app crashed over and over again and charged me outrageous fees. Kraken to the rescue. So happy I moved all of my assets to Kraken. Easy and fast transactions and hasn’t crashed once since downloading 3 months ago. Kraken for the win!

You can’t ever get a straight answer out of anybody because I want the bots to do all the communication so I real person doesn’t have to get involved and take responsibility.

They blocked my transfer. Said the money would be return into the app which it hasn’t been. Then I would have to sell it and cash out to my bank.

Beware that your account may close if you make a transfer. $25 is no big deal but it’s the principle of it. They will take your money and lie to keep it."
kraken,ios,GamerMVP87,5,2023-06-09 16:59:02,"As a User in the USA, Kraken has coins on it that Coinbase doesn’t have, and I can instantly buy Stablecoins and transfer them out. Coinbase makes me wait 4-7 days to be able to transfer coins off the exchange. The Pro exchange is great as well!

They solve all support questions by telling you they will submit a request to a different department and solve do nothing.  Then several hours later they will send you an email notifying you your account is closed and ban you from Kraken completely.  If they are asked for clarification on being banned, they respond by saying any future accounts in your name will be banned as well."
kraken,ios,LucieBG,5,2025-01-18 00:27:18,I appreciate Kraken so much because it’s easier to transfer money in and out for your transactions instead of waiting for days for your deposits to post!! You have to buy while the stock dips!!

I try to reopen the account and for security reasons they won’t reopen even though they never explain the problem or why they closed my account with money pending on the transfer. Terrible if I could give no stars I would."

kraken,ios,youf1000,5,2025-03-05 20:11:28,No other exchange would let me verify my identity.

I love their exchange so much I’d recommend it to anyone who’s looking into buying bitcoin or any cryptocurrency
kraken,ios,1st Bank762,5,2024-10-24 04:01:54,I’ve had less issues using Kraken than other apps and I can easily use the interface. It does what I need it to do but just wish they still supported the Russian Ruble

kraken,ios,AyBen_Gh,5,2023-07-18 02:50:56,I love it. For canadian living in Ontario it is the most reliable way to transfer and buy crypto. There is just one thing that bothers me a lot. It takes 72 hours to transfer money from your card to the Kraken! It is annoying.
kraken,ios,EllieS197,1,2023-08-30 16:39:18,"I downloaded the app about a month ago. After linking my bank and routing information, I initiated a deposit. After 3 weeks of the transfer not going through, I submitted a help ticket and talked with a specialist. After a few hours they responded and said they were closing my account and due to security reasons, could not disclose why they had to close it. They also said I could not open another account. 

Awesome."

1. The customer service and commercial onboarding are excellent.  Super helpful.
2. Both personal and business accounts are serviced with responsiveness.
3. UI is great as well with both a pro and simple personal interface.  
4. Buying and withdrawing is easy.  Excellent stepping off point into the deeper aspects of digital assets and De-fi.

Would be great to see a more robust coin offering, but it’s great.  Oh, and they don’t lend your assets, kind of important."

It works for awhile and then does it again. Can’t believe an app I’m trading 5-10k in doesn’t work. So reassuring lol. Guess I’ll have to transfer everything to Binance. At least their app actually works…

kraken,ios,Not a happy former client,1,2024-05-13 23:31:23,Research Kraken before using their application.  Closed my account without providing a reason for the closure.

#2 I deposited money multiple times. KRAKEN had an issue DAYS later with ONE transaction because of KRAKENS PAYMENT PROCESSOR ERROR. 

Now Kraken is requiring me to deposit money to fix it BUT has blocked ALL deposit methods.

I cannot use Debit card. I cannot use plaid or trustly. Nothing.

Their support is unresponsive and won’t connect me with a manager.

They’re threatening to liquidate my positions if I don’t deposit YET I cannot deposit.

#3 Pro Limits verification takes EXTREMELY LONG

#4 I do not feel Kraken is trustworthy after my experiences."

Coinbase does allow users to see net profits and losses on their crypto assets making it a superior Cryptocurrency platform.
kraken,ios,frendaddy,2,2022-06-05 17:53:47,"There is a fee to do anything and everything in this app and it’s not a little bit. We’re talking 7% of money you put in is pretty likely to vanish. It’s a good concept don’t get me wrong, just too many fees to use for storing any large sum of wealth."

Admittedly privacy is probably not as high as some other more advanced options but I feel the security is relatively strong.

kraken,android,Brian Pullen,1,2025-03-24 17:41:43,"all the advertisements said it is so quick and easy but you have to wait 72-96 hours from the time of trade and then you will have to wait up to 48hrs to complete withdrawals. do not fall for this. It's anything but fast! coinbase is faster and cheaper for transferring, buying, or selling. Coinbase takes 24 hrs maximum!!! that's what this app claims to do but it's a lie don't support them!!!"
kraken,android,Anthony Daggs,5,2025-03-24 14:04:34,better then coinbase

I cant navigate through the app. nothing I press responds or even vibrates to acknowledge I pressed it. I cant see my portfolio, I cant even scroll down on the main page that loads that has the most popular coins of the day. There are no updates. I uninstalled and reinstalled and it started to work. less than 5 minutes later its unresponsive yet again. FIX YOUR APP."

kraken,android,Joseph Saylor,1,2025-03-21 06:43:45,Oof what a difference a year makes! This app used to be pretty decent but now it's brutally slow and unresponsive. Kraken has also become loaded down with every scam crypto imaginable. I would be pretty concerned using this platform to trade. Imagine an outage at an inconvenient time? Not sure I could ever trust my money here again like I did at one time. If it's slow to navigate think about trying to actually trade?

I am only disappointed with this new version because I still don't get my average cost, I have to do the math. Total invested divided by total coins... it is so simple and should be a basic function of this app! update after reply... I look forward to this ""upgrade"" to the Kraken app and with that I'm sure Kraken will be my favorite of the 5 exchange apps I use now. Thanks for responding to the feedback."

It turns the photos you take and it does not matter what type of document you try to use, it keeps being stuck at the one step."
kraken,android,Doge Master,1,2025-03-04 22:03:42,Don't use this app to buy crypto especially if David Portnoy is promoting it. Because we all know he is a rug pulling scammer. I don't recommend this app because they can liquidate all of your assets so if you have any money in their exchange they can literally just make any reason to take your money. That's how they get rich so don't invest using Kraken it's not trustworthy not only do they have extremely long hold times but the app is really clunky not smooth in the customer service is bad.
kraken,android,CLIVE CODLING,5,2025-03-04 21:59:38,Kraken is very easy to use. Recommended

kraken,android,Kim Breitbach,3,2025-03-04 11:19:55,Good in general. Way too slow esp when trying to create a sell order. Update: Still slow and causes issues when I want to buy at a certain price. It's usually when it's busy. Updates don't help. I have a Samsung s22 ultra. Kraken pro is fine Update Feb 24 2025: Last update we saw a whole new interface that seems to freeze less. I continue to update the app regularly and it seems to hold up much better. Freezes do happen and I have to reinstall one a week. So far things have not gotten smoother

kraken,android,Ben Kahn,1,2025-03-03 14:31:07,"I've used kraken for some.years now and the app for a couple years. Now the app interface does not function proper. I am not able to deposit or withdraw tokens in my portfolio! Luckily the website functions on a phone device so that provides a work around, but it takes more time and involves several steps. And fees and prices offered for assets are getting ridiculous ie buying or selling at a 2% spread from listed price + 1%+ fee. I know crypto ain't Mom& pop, but kraken was better."

I will say they're updated website & app is more confusing then the older style they were using it was very simple I wish there was a way to go back using it as an option to keep it simplified especially for those that are not used to the whole cryptocurrency thing. maybe that's something they could look into just to keep it simple until people get their footing but overall a wonderful secure company definitely recommend

kraken,android,Jack Kisat,5,2025-02-24 21:35:05,"I decided to learn how crypto functions. After reading many reviews, i chose Kraken as it seemed like the best fit for me to dip my toe in and try it out. After all the verifications and setup, it was actually quite easy. It helps to remember that kraken is a crypto exchange and not a wallet. A crypto wallet is different from a crypto exchange. As for using Kraken...I don't do any weird stuff yet, just buying crypto and learning."
kraken,android,Leslie Hoover,1,2025-02-24 16:31:50,"There is a reason this app has SO many 1 star reviews. It is a terrible application ! I emailed the company to delete my banking information after I uninstalled their app, and they said they had to RETAIN all my info for future reference. There are a lot of other good crypto apps on the web, DONT get this one."
kraken,android,Alejandro Rodriguez Mann,1,2025-02-24 15:38:24,"I love this app but now the colors look so ugly since the downgrade!! . It's very friendly and convenient for me. I do have a request: recurring withdrawals. Set conditions such as: withdraw Bitcoin when reaching 0.004 BTC to ""x"" address and when the transaction fee is less than ""y"" or at any price. This would make me automate everything.!"
kraken,android,Liav E,2,2025-02-24 06:15:47,What did you do to this app? Im getting wrong updates about prices all the time.
kraken,android,Justin,1,2025-02-24 03:47:35,"New UI is awful. Look into different options than this app! Update, their response to my rating is dismissive and felt like it was written by an AI. The updated features are worse then that past version of the app!! Double disappointed."
kraken,android,Sharon Hen,2,2025-02-23 19:02:10,"When trying to fill out bank account details, it only asks me to fill in the nickname and does not direct me to fill in the bank details. It is not listed the profit percentage on the coins I purchased."
kraken,android,Mark,3,2025-02-23 16:56:01,New update is sooooo slow! EDIT: You misunderstand. It updated fine. Your new app design is what's slow. Info takes ages to load. Fancy animations is one thing but waiting for info to load when you just want a quick glance at what's going on is quite frustrating. Your old app was fine with loading speeds. Nothing wrong with my Internet btw.
kraken,android,Bryan Edwards,1,2025-02-23 08:14:07,Since the most recent update the app is completely dead. Nothing works and it won't load.

kraken,android,Paul Nam,1,2025-02-23 00:23:37,"Used to be the best crypto trading app. But this new update is really terrible, runs super slow, can't make any trades. I'll have to use the web browser on desktop. To be clear I'm a very loyal, long time Kraken user. But this particular update to the app (despite fancy) really sucks. It's unusable. Update 2/22: The New app is working well now, I'm able to trade (buy/sell) no problems. Thanks for listening to customer feedback, it's working great now!"

kraken,android,Or BH,4,2025-02-22 11:21:56,Easy to buy and sell.
kraken,android,Mike T,2,2025-02-22 11:03:54,"I was a victim of Inbound phone support scam. Got a call from someone from Kraken who knew my name, email and exactly which crypto I had held. Told me there was a security issue and that they were to help me secure it. They took all my life savings and the entire scam took 5 minutes. Kraken can't help at all so I reported it to FBI. I don't trust using this app."
kraken,android,Don White,1,2025-02-22 09:01:18,So ....you disable my app but make it impossible to update.... I do not want to chat I just want to be able to use the system I have money in

kraken,android,Midnight Llama,3,2025-02-21 20:14:47,Great app but this latest update gives it a glam up and slows the navigation down. No longer are snappy as before. Kind of like the old sparkly windows vista. Hope they can restore the speed or have a Lite option
kraken,android,Drew,3,2025-02-21 15:34:21,New update is very buggy

kraken,android,sean meles,5,2025-02-20 23:52:56,The new UI isn't bad but I still prefer the old one. Also the market cap is important Kraken team should bring it back even continue with the new UI. (Even I'm complaining yes it's 5 stars. Everything else is perfect)

kraken,android,Haman's Gallows,4,2025-02-20 07:37:04,"Really like the Custom Buy option. Been able to snag some solid buys while I was sleeping. Interface is fairly intuitive. Really don't like the weekly ACH spend limits. I'd use the app a lot more if it wasn't nannying me about how much I'm able to spend ($3000/week, I think). Good secondary app."
kraken,android,Rusty Shackelford,1,2025-02-20 05:25:42,"I just tried to deposit some POL and Kraken says the transaction failed, but Polygon scan disagrees. (No I didn't accidentally send MATIC). If this is how kraken lies, I will be switching to another CEX. Like why the hell lie and take my money openly?"
kraken,android,Joanes Grandjean,2,2025-02-20 04:08:34,The new ui update really doesn't work for me. It is painfully slow to load and poorly reactive. By default it shows me 'most popular' assets instead of watchlist. (It is a watchlist for a reason).
kraken,android,Ariana Coleman,5,2025-02-20 01:00:56,App works great. Very professional feeling and loads fast. Very happy with my 2 years of experience with this app.

I'm not a huge fan of Coinbase but this app is junk. With the exception of the charts, compared to Fidelity and Schwab, this is app is absolute garbage."
kraken,android,Ismail Akram,3,2025-02-18 16:48:41,"It was great app until it wasn't. I used to check 24hrs highest and lowest values of coins in the app and now that is gone, which is a downgrade for me. Now I have to move slider around to check those values, which isn't convenient."

How is it possible a APP that makes so much money in fees daily is so slow like it was made in the stoneage . Takes literally EVERYTIME so long to send or do ANYTHING . INVEST IN YOUR APP .

Unbelievable -- Update: reached out to the support team. They closed my account and I got my USD stuck in there because they had a minimum $100 withdrawal amount.
kraken,android,Hector Rebollo,1,2025-02-18 01:53:50,I have been almost 4 months with my money completely blocked. Seems like it is an issue only in Germany after calling them but still it is insane. I do NOT recommend it. 2 months!!! This can't be possible. They say they need more info but when I call them they say there is no more info required but I just have to wait. Good customer service for a really bad service in my experience.
kraken,android,My Random Mind,5,2025-02-17 13:06:56,Great app! I just started into crypto in 2024 & Kraken was the best company that I found had a smooth onboarding experience. I read all the documentation and there were no surprises. I am this far pleased!

My first transaction had a reasonable withdrawal fee; second transaction had a disgustingly high withdrawal fee (equivalent to 1/6th of my purchase).

The market is volatile enough on its own, but to have your purchase price different by approx $1,600.00 is ridiculous. The margins and percentages are greatly affected by Kraken's hidden fees. Other venues have a confirmation page so that you see exactly what the purchase price will be. I will be using those now."

kraken,android,Andy Choi,1,2025-01-31 22:22:47,"These guys don't let you sell when the price goes up, constantly making the system unavailable, neither to see the order details previously prepared in advance nor letting me sell a big portion of it... What is the point of using the platform that the user can't sell when an opportunity comes...? It is just the same like Robinhood... same crooked business practices... Very disappointing..."
kraken,android,Dylan Druffel,5,2025-01-31 20:24:14,"Easy to use. Really, like its functionality."
kraken,android,Obert Magona,3,2025-01-31 18:39:57,"The trading platform is commendable; however, it is perplexing that withdrawals cannot be processed using Zimbabwean Mastercards or Visa cards, especially considering that deposits can be made with these same cards."
kraken,android,Manuel Fabritius,1,2025-01-31 17:02:41,KYC process is broken. After webid the sms code must be entered. But opening the SMS closes the inApp browser with the webid session. Therefore the corresponding session is closed and the code cannot be entered.👌 Please fix it 🤌

Scam scam scam. Stay away. EDIT: Putting my ticket number in, so I can MAYBE (probably not, there goes my $200) get some help. Ticket # 15143602"

kraken,android,Joy Shahbazian,1,2025-01-31 04:42:12,"Kraken has cracked up. There is nothing like completing all KYC to have your account flagged and deactivated. This is common practice. It seems to be more of an attempt to collect personal data than a functional exchange. Lots of negative feedback, accounts randomly closed, and funds frozen."
kraken,android,Muhammad Bilal,1,2025-01-31 02:46:50,"Worst kyc process, super slow and irresponsive system, applied for kyc almost 7 days ago and still saying pending verification, even manual.system is faster than this application, not recommended"

That is not against terms. So anyone planning to use this platform should know that they can and will close your account with zero warning and they will not provide an explanation. There's plenty of better options . I'd completely understand if I did something wrong, I wouldn't be wasting my time here."

Than I wait...get a reply Jan 16 2025 saying it noticed my message and asked if I need further help. Um.. yes you never completed the task. Than I wait once again...basically gave up.

The entire process from creating an account, the KYC process, funding your account, researching/exploring the many assets, to purchasing the asset... It's all so easy to navigate thru.

kraken,android,frostbitten kingdoms,4,2025-01-20 02:50:09,What happened to showing the date when dragging around the charts. Is this a bug? It's always showing 2.am in the morning no matter wherever I drag around the chart. I can't look up a price at specific moments in time cause it doesn't tell me the time and date. I'm pretty sure this worked in the past.

Coinbase allowed me to receive USDT (SOL) only to pull the rug last second and refuse to cash it in or transfer it. The only option was to request my family to send me SOL for transfer fee because Coinbase would sell me SOL but wouldn't transfer it to my wallet. Just endless pain. Managed to pull USDT to Kraken and they cashed it. Zero issues so far."

Performance data is almost non existent lacking in something as basic as gain/loss display in $ value as well as a % value. A lot of impoving is necessary to make this app convenient and useful. Edit: kraken pro is still lacking much info. Why have 2 versions of the same app. Should be an options setting in the regular version to see more info.

I utilize a variety of wallets to participate in an assortment of Web3 platforms. If other wallets weren’t required, I would only use OKX. I don’t have to open OKX prior to connecting, like other wallets, to preset anything, I just click & go. I just wish the exchange was accessible in the US. There are too many location restrictions associated with residing in the USA regarding crypto. The SEC needs to take a chill pill! So many company leaders in crypto are moving their headquarters out of the US due to the scrutiny (huge fine$) received from the SEC. I look forward to a day when I can use ALL of the services OKX offers, both wallet & EXCHANGE!! Back off SEC!!"

Update (10 seconds later)..lol
And another thing, most exchanges have far more features and accessibility on their actual website, but this application is literally designed to mimic the website but even easier! This is a first for me finding an app this good in the App Store and general much less a crypto currency trading application which are very hard to come by as it is on iOS"
okx,ios,M.K.H 210,1,2025-03-05 06:52:19,"This review is for OKX - UAE
If there were an option to give this app less than one star, I would absolutely choose it. I have wasted more than two weeks waiting for account verification, despite what the FAQ and support articles say. They claim the process should take up to 24 hours, when I reached out to support, they told me it would take 72 hours. After following up again, they said it could take up to a week!!!  And yet, well past the week-long deadline and yet no response.
Support team will not give you clear answers – they will give different timeframe to get you off the line. They are misleading potential customers with false promises just to keep them on the hook! Is the verification process supposed to take 24 hours, 72 hours, a week, or a month,?! they do not have a definite answer they simply lie straight to your face? Pick a timeframe and stick to it!
Engaging with support is an absolute waste of time. It is even worse than talking to their bot—you get nothing but scripted, meaningless responses with zero help.
I have been using other trading apps; this is by far the worst trading app out there. Imagine if your money was at stake and you needed help, only to be ignored by a team that clearly does not care.
Avoid this App at all cost. do not fall for the trap, as they are not what they claim to be."

When I went to report it there was no one to report to or talk to.  I tracked down my money from one site to another when I found it it had left the country and they refused to give it back.  Also they never let you transfer money back out.  They pretty much were the worst of every part and were completely useless.  Never use no matter what.  I think all the good reviews are fake as none of them I read were at all in line with my experience. Don’t use no matter what.

And 1.5 months they just stopped responding to support messages just ignoring. Finally they canceled the withdrawal transaction and fund came back. I suspect this exchange has liquidity problems or has Bernd’s hacked or something therefore they just froze customers funds - how convenient. Also I think most Reviews/Ratings are bought- the app is absolutely nothing special snd deserves 3.5-4 maximum!

The app is pretty simple to use, but it’s a fake trading platform.  Any bitcoin you send them (or any crypto you think you have with them) has already gone. You’ve lost it. You can’t get it back. At some point the crypto you think you own will suddenly drop to low values and you’ll have been scammed.

okx,ios,Zaharius,1,2024-04-26 07:35:51,"Be careful using OKX , the app has lots of unclear surprises when you have money on the exchange and trying to get out or swap.

Not only they charge 3 times more for simple usdt transfer, but also require you to pay fee in the eco system token, which you need to swap too. But that also has a minimum.

For example to send 200 USDT to another exchange you need to 3.25$ of Tron (trc20) token. But you only can change minimum 20$usdt, so you end up leaving 17$ on a exchange or paying another 3$ to move them.
This is just one example, i can give you 5 more.

Bitcoin, minimum swap 300$, and you dont know until you move money there and they get stuck. 

Simply this exchange is tricky and trying to catch you there, with unfair ways. Very centralized."

Do not download this platform!
I transferred funds from another blockchain wallet to OKX, but I was unable to receive them. Despite explaining the issue and providing the necessary information, including the transaction details, they told me it would take 7 to 14 days to verify. By the time they finish their review, my tokens will have already lost their value. I transferred them specifically to stop further losses, but such a simple issue is not being handled promptly. It’s obvious they want to swallow my money. Everyone, do not download this platform!!!!!!!!!

千万不要下载，我从别的链上钱包转到这里，但是无法收到，但是他们明白什么问题，需要提交的资料和转账交易也给了，他们居然说要7到14天时间验证，等这么久我的币早就跌没了，就是为了止损才转的，这么简单的问题他们不积极处理。很明显是要吞了我的钱。请大家不要下载！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！"

okx,ios,A hurt customer 2024,1,2024-09-17 15:22:44,"I've been using OKEx for a while and always found it quite good. However, in the past two days, I discovered that OKEx has actually frozen the withdrawal function on my account. When I click on ""withdraw,"" it says it’s blocked due to platform risk control. There was no prior notification or email before this happened. When I contacted customer support, I was told it was due to triggering their risk control, and now I have to wait for their review. I asked what the specific reason was, but the customer service representative said they didn't know. I also asked how long the process would take, as it’s unreasonable for me to wait indefinitely. Again, they said they didn't know. I was very dissatisfied with the service, and when I requested to file a complaint, the representative told me they had the highest level of authority to handle this issue and that I would just have to wait, with no other options. As for complaining about the customer service itself, they said it would be handled internally, but they wouldn’t notify or inform customers about the outcome. If OKEx had originally posted a notice on their platform stating that they could freeze customer accounts without any conditions, I wouldn’t have chosen to use it. But they didn't notify me, and they can arbitrarily freeze customer accounts, while their customer service treats a legitimate issue with such an attitude, which I find unacceptable. Is OKEx about to go bankrupt? Could this be their final attempt to grab as much as they can? I urge anyone considering using OKEx to think carefully, as they can freeze your account at any time."

I am a computer engineer i know what is going on with the issue. But due to i don’t have access to your coding i cant fix it debug the code and fix it myself. So fix the issue in your coding and stop acting like every user is dumb. 

Old review:
So pairing the keystone was no problem loaded all the balances on the accounts correctly but when checking the swap section even though the tron account balance goes through fine in viewing and the receive address is correct the app prompts the hardware wallet doesn’t support the tron network. Kinda confusing that i can not swap on the tron network but i can view my tron account balance in the okx app (web3 wallet section) paired with a keystone device. I tried re-pairing it still shows the same error prompt in swap section."

okx,ios,Andrew 👑 Tape,5,2024-02-15 04:49:27,"Switching to OKX has turbocharged my crypto trading experience. Don't forget to punch in code 👑TAPE10👑 when you sign up to grab a 10% cut on those trading fees and a shot at a $60,000 windfall after your first deposit 💰. 

What really sets OKX apart are the razor-thin trading fees, kicking off at just 0.1% per trade. This is a big deal for anyone looking to keep costs down while playing the crypto markets. And if you're an OKB token holder, you're in for even lower fees, adding a cherry on top of an already sweet deal 🍒.

The depth of trading tools and features on OKX is something else. Whether you're into futures with up to 100x leverage, dabbling in options, or setting up those complex stop-limit orders, OKX has got the goods. And with DeFi, staking, lending, and an NFT marketplace in the mix, it's like a crypto Swiss Army knife!"
okx,ios,Am Rob,1,2024-09-23 20:32:01,"I am an American citizen. My USDT was transferred from another site. This site stole my USDT and exchanged it for a worthless coin. In other words, money laundering. I tried to transfer some funds to Crypto.com. When it didn’t arrive, Crypto informed me that the Crypto transferred was worthless.

When I contacted the site, they told me that the site software needed to be rewritten and that the withdrawal function was disabled. I was also informed that it would take more than a month before customers would be able to withdraw funds.

After almost two months, I received the following messages.

“You need to deposit 3500.00USDT to activate it.
After successful activation. 3500.00 USDT will be returned to your account together”

Nothing says scam like demanding funds to withdraw your funds. This is just another money laundering site in which money goes in and doesn’t come out. 

Beware. There are many sites that don’t charge money to withdraw funds. This isn’t one of them."

You could lose a lot of money with the time they take to verify. In app they said it would take 24 hours but no answer after 24 hours. I emailed them and they raised it could take up 72 hours. We'll it's been 144 hours and still didn't answered only after the email . Better find better exchanges this one is risky

kucoin,ios,Cyclophantom,5,2022-02-13 03:34:11,"Been on this exchange for almost 8 months and it’s come a long way. The ONLY major exchange I have found, available for use in the US, to offer derivatives (long/short w/ leverage) and a plethora of leveraged swaps. They have FREE TO USE, IN EXCHANGE trading bots!!!! no API keys or suspect integration. Very easy to set up, and you can have 10 running simultaneously. Not to mention the Staking options have grown a bunch just in the past few months alone. I’ve been hounding the team to develop a desktop app, but I mainly use the web client as a 32’ screen is a lil easier to view charts on, as opposed to a phone😂 A few things I would like to see: - We need order-triggers-order and order-cancels-order options for trading and futures! - Make a desktop app! - The ability to do derivative future strategies (like a straddle or straggle) would also be amazing considering arbitrage portfolios are a thing now. You can currently run a bot straddle strategy, but its not quite the same! Overall, 9.5/10 UI is gorgeous and night mode rocks Coin variety is top notch Want to go short? Not a problem here! 🤖bots! 🤖"

I thought what’s the use if I can’t even trade my money or my crypto well here’s a little note for anybody this happens to, it’s not KU coins fault, first off when you go to do your identity in your photos remember if you’re using an iPhone it’s not shooting in JPEG unless you go change it on your settings, JPEG is the format that your photo ID documents need to be in for KU coin to use to unbind Google 2FA! Thank you KU coin for being honest for emailing me for telling me that you found my crypto, for telling me that it was safe, and for telling me that I could do it myself all I had to do was read a little bit more and I did and I figured it out, so if this is happened to you don’t give up on KU coin learn and then learn some more you’ll be just fine!"

This app is a scamming, wasteful and most hazardous piece of technology I have ever witnessed they should not be on the App Store and should definitely not be working with peoples money at all"

A LOT of money can be made using it, and the KCS coin is a great utility token you can earn while just holding a few. If you are in the U.S. just do what they ask of the KYC docs KuCoin requests you to do, you will still be able to use the exchange regardless, the main thing is only transfer in stable coins (USDT, USDC, UST) don’t go adding your debit card number or any of that. Do not listen to the FUD you read here in the reviews, yes they were hacked back in 2020, but have since remitted every penny and then some with insurance and restitution money. Not only that, they’re security has become 10 fold stronger since the incident. It has leverage on all the best coin PERPs, though I highly recommend getting used to the app first. It will take time but once you get the hang of it, you will LOVE KC!"
kucoin,ios,BD9,2,2022-02-13 18:29:44,Are usually use Bybit but I decided to start using KuCoin seem like a better app in trading platform so I went ahead and deposited money and started using some bots problem is the one bought you can only use on the mobile app so for some odd reason it worked on the mobile app so after I set everything up everything was working fine and then a day later I go to check and it will not let me get into the bot won’t let me send feedback Customer Service is almost non-supportive and they keep telling me to update to newer version 3.49.1 but there’s inly 3.49.0 in AppStore there is now 3.50.0 which still has done nothing to solve the problem they also said turn off your phone and reinstall app which I did and check vpn. I did everything they said to do and it still does not work I still can’t check my bot keeps saying timed out . I can’t even send feedback won’t let me and customer service takes forever.  Good thing I didn’t transfer 100k over and put in to mobile bot. Wish someone would help.  I liked the app at first but now not so much
kucoin,ios,larrylevwrage,5,2022-01-28 14:07:18,"I have loved using futures until here recently, I buy in at a certain price look down and the market price puts me down 5-10 dollars already. I’ve also recently bought deduction coupons and have yet to see fees be 100% deducted it truly makes no sense. I also set a stop loss and it doesn’t trigger until the actual price gets there but market price will be 10 or more dollars passed that so instead of the price I actually selected to lose I lose way more than I actually wanted to which is absolutely stupid and a scam! Fix this stuff now or continue to lose people who use this app"
kucoin,ios,AndrewLeeWoolard,1,2021-02-10 12:30:28,"I consider myself an avid trader who knows what they’re doing. But Kucoin will destroy any hope you have. When trading futures, it feels like my trades specifically are picked and wiped out and then immediately trend the direction I bet on. When I place a limit order, I can see the price start to fluctuate as soon as I type an order that would be fulfilled in my favor. I have placed opposite sided trades on a second device and BOTH sides were SHORTED on a volume of maybe 100 coins of a sub dollar coin within 15 minutes. I have screen recorded trading showing how the app practically tracks my inputs since they also know my exact percentages and what it would take to wipe out a trade. The trading bot is also worthless. You pay more in GRID gains than you make no matter how you set it up, and the bots also contribute to the problem with futures. 

Stay away from this horrible trading app. You can only make money holding (unless they take your coin off the market then your holdings are gone too), which I also bet they use to manipulate prices when you’re not using. That’s what staking off chain is as well, hence the lower apr you get."
kucoin,ios,theguyyoucanthatebecausevirtue,4,2021-10-15 23:49:37,"I’ve loved this app since day one. I’ve been using it a long time and they have made thousands off of me. 
But Kucoin is beginning to severely worry me. This is a trading app, not a HODLing app. 
Therefor you need to be able to trade. Kucoin has started crashing at very crucial times. I lost over 30% of my portfolio because I tried to initiate a sell and Kucoin’s network went down for the 6th time that week because it got a little busy and had to do it’s job a little harder. poof. gone.  6 months of savings and trading gone in 20 minutes, not from a bad trade. It was an excellent trade. Kucoin just couldn’t follow-through. 
People are putting their faith in crypto currency because they are sick of banks and conglomerates incompetence and greed losing their money for them. I’m those 20 minutes. Everything is up to date. Kucoin simply is failing when it gets busy and people are losing 10s of thousands as a result. 
Kucoin- fix your problems immediately.
 some of us work in journalism and will end this apps American base faster than you can can “network error :)”
I’ll need to see consistent improvements and hopefully some kind of statement from Kucoin about the problems soon or I’m out and am ensuring  as many people as possible are aware of it"

I’ve been trying to get it reset since October and we are almost at the New Years. I’ve provided them with everything they’ve asked for yet the continue not responding and giving me the run around. Then, mysteriously started asking for transactions to another wallet which made no sense. Please beware of this app, I’m losing hope I’ll ever get my money back and hope it doesn’t happen to you

**update** still no progress. We’re 4 months and counting and still haven’t been able to get my money. One would figure they pick up the phone and call. Nope, they take weeks to respond via email and come up with new reasons to not allow me to use my money. Please be aware as this isn’t getting any better and hope you don’t lose money. A developer commented that I should worry and rest assured they’d help. Doesn’t really seem like I can just hang back while my money is stolen with no progress."
kucoin,ios,Quitplaying21,1,2021-10-25 18:41:00,"I felt the need to write my first ever review on the Apple App Store for this. I downloaded this app to use future trading. The app freezes up and will not allow me to execute a trade on several occasions.  Ironically it seems to have these “glitches” whenever I am up profit on an asset. The app will not allow Me to execute a trade claiming “network” issues and forcing me to hold my position while all the profits deplete and actually fall into the negative mark before finally allowing me to trade. These experiences have left a terrible taste in my mouth and I can’t help but think the creators are pulling a fast one. I have lost over $3,000 because of my experiences using this application. (All of my other trading platforms would work perfectly during these described issues and I was able to execute perfect trades on every other platform I utilize) so they cannot claim it is my own personal network. I would be very cautious before downloading this application."
kucoin,ios,etttcc,1,2023-07-01 13:57:09,"I have been trading for years. TA is useless in this considering it can pump and dump at any moment. ONE MAJOR ISSUE, Kucoin charges insane fees. They will take %50 of your profit and they do not tell you before you execute the trade how much they will take. MARGIN SCAM. Be careful with margin trading on here. If you are on the right side of your trade they slowly lower your margin as the trade goes in your favor. However, if you are on the wrong side of. A trade they increase the margin as it goes against you! This is there way of minimizing your gains and maximizing your losses. This is how they make money. So they have a big incentive to make you lose which could be a massive conflict of interest. Be careful on this app ***** UPDATE: Kucoin sees your stop losses and take profits. They will purposely drive the price towards your stop loss even when basic TA shows it’s extremely unlikely. These people are criminals be careful. ALGOS ACTIVELY TRADE AGAINST YOU IT IS AMAZING TO WATCH THE BID AND ASK FLIP SOMETIMES. CRIMINALS"
kucoin,ios,Tad W WN,1,2024-03-29 00:00:06,"I am writing to express my deep dissatisfaction with the service provided by KuCoin Exchange regarding my recent attempt to withdraw funds from my account. I encountered an issue where I was asked to verify my identity and location, after which I was informed that withdrawals are not allowed in my region.I find this situation unacceptable as it implies a lack of transparency and raises concerns about the security of my funds. It feels like a deliberate attempt to prevent me from accessing my money, which is extremely concerning and borders on scamming.I request an immediate resolution to this matter and urge KuCoin to reconsider its policies to ensure that all users, regardless of their location, are able to access and withdraw their funds without unnecessary obstacles. Failure to address this issue promptly will force me to seek alternative platforms for my cryptocurrency transactions.I hope for a swift and satisfactory resolution to this matter."
kucoin,ios,Tarkkus,4,2022-05-20 05:05:17,"Great app, use it daily. But could improve on (SPEED) and remove 3 second ads when opening the app. And mainly please add (% CHANGE )on the coins holding and portfolio so it could be seen it quickly, and in order when scrolling through the holdings. Instead of opening each coin and pair to see daily % change.

Also when using futures, it’s takes a while to submits orders, and sometimes the position disappears for few seconds until close out the app or refresh. 
And seems when placing a market buy or sell, it always executed at the highest price or lowest prices then jumps back to the price not in your favor."
kucoin,ios,W5552,5,2021-12-09 11:56:28,"It’s good. This is gonna pretty much make me ALL OF THE MONEY.

I’m basically trying to make enough from this bot to build a rocket that I can beat Elon Musk to mars with so I can be there when he shows up just to be like .. .. yeah. .. there’s nothing here dude.

I deposited a little more than 800 bucks worth of shib like 4 minutes ago and this app is already asking for this review. That my friend is confidence!🎩

1- customer support… it is very hard to get thru and get a prompt reply
2- fiat … if there’s a way KuCoin can set up the ability to accept fiat currency without the confusing and expensive option they recently added this would bring more users to the platform 
3- on chain debit card … if they would institute one of these like some exchanges have done this is another thing would greatly expand their membership"

kucoin,ios,algo to infinity and beyond,2,2021-12-28 07:18:48,"This app/platform all around is pretty amazing and by far the most advanced of its kind. BUT there has been numerous situations including the most recent leading me to leave a negative review. KuCoin buy/sell/market orders will sometimes not complete or go through. This requires you to refresh the app, wasting time in between your trades. What is the point of trading on an app where I have to refresh one to several times before I can make my trade. Lost thousands from this issue I am describing, and each time it pushes me closer towards finding an alternative exchange that doesn’t require manual refreshing while trading positions. There are lots of bots and manipulation within this app, and I’m growing more weary of it by the day. Closer and closer to becoming a rigged casino game rather than a decentralized crypto exchange."
kucoin,ios,MiracleMage,2,2021-03-21 20:24:22,"I’ve been trading stocks for a while now, so I signed up for KuCoin thinking ‘how hard can it possibly be?’ Well, they’ve made me cry ‘Uncle!’ This is the most confusing interface I’ve ever seen in my life. I wanted to use this exchange because they do have a huge number of coins to trade. I think I’m going to withdraw my funds and go back to the main coins and forget it, though. It doesn’t help that it takes a really long time for a deposit to go from your checking account, through Banxa or Simplex, and arrive in your trading account. While you’re thinking ‘OK, where the heck is my money?!’ (It’s been over an hour since I KNEW where that 10k was.) and, of course, ‘customer service’ is basically an FAQ Bot. I’m 67th in line to chat with online assistance. I’m not currently a big fan, as I’m sure you can tell. 🤬"

Unfortunately, my experience hasn't been as positive. I've encountered issues with pending trades that have remained unresolved for over four months, which is concerning. Additionally, there have been instances where trades were marked as paid, but the counterparty went offline for extended periods, leading to a frustrating trading experience.

I have reached out to the support team multiple times seeking resolution but have not seen satisfactory progress. This situation has significantly impacted my trading activities and confidence in the platform.

I hope this feedback can be seen as an opportunity for KuCoin to enhance its support services and trading system, ensuring a more reliable and user-friendly experience for all traders."
kucoin,ios,shelbsanne,1,2021-12-10 07:19:42,"Kucoin needs to get shut down by some agency in the US.. everything is done to get you liquidated. My 20x future was liquidated when the market dropped 2.4%… if you do the math, my position should not have been liquidated. It wasn’t due to “spread”. From my average cost to the lowest low on the futures pair, it should have never been liquidated (20x on -2.4% from average cost does not equal 100%). It is about time somebody goes after Kucoin in the US.

This has been a problem for me the whole time using Kucoin. Lost tens of thousands because of this and their “random” log out event that occurs when market tanks. They log you out completely randomly, often. It prevents you from logging in. No SMS sent to log in. If you have positions open you will not be able to get to them. Their ethics and practices are beyond illegal in US."
kucoin,ios,Swurveey,5,2022-07-13 03:25:34,"Love the websites interface could be updated more but that’s neither here nor there. For the most part I love the fast withdrawals and low trading fees and spreads. I’m a Futures day trader so these factors are always important. The only  problem I do have is Futures 2.0 is rolling out and we still aren’t able to set multiple take profit or stop orders in one trade, I think the serious would traders would love that feature binance has it and works really well not top compare the two but I think it’s also a needed function."
kucoin,ios,444 Zack 444,1,2023-06-22 02:47:30,"After updating months ago I’ve lost the ability to borrow USDT as well as any coins for more than 7 Day Terms. Even when I click 14 & 28 day terms it still gives me 7 day. This is extremely frustrating especially during what was the beginning of a Bull Market. I’ve updated several more times and the problem still persists. 

Futures are the only way to avoid this. 

Also since you guys occasionally ask for feedback about how to improve the app, I think we should be able to see our entry price when margin trading like you can when trading futures... Realized gains would be nice as well since that’s also a feature on futures and not with margin trading or even spot trading. That’s like golden rule #1 to a trading platform. Entry price, & realized / unrealized gains..."
kucoin,ios,yeah... no..,1,2022-11-25 19:01:32,"Great rewards, advanced trading platform.

However, questionable ethics and customer support. At some point in time, their software will malfunction(this is definite). When this happens, you’ll contact support, and then they’ll have made a maintenance post after the fact. I know this to be true because after the first time. I always started checking their news feed(not like you should receive a direct notification, and a reminder), this happened multiple other times and support will always just reply with the post that was after the fact. 

So, you’re out of a considerable sum; your trading volume is consistently 100k+ a month; you’d think that they’d be happy to make things right. No, the support people are glorified FAQ’s. They’ll send your info off to another team. That team will not read anything and respond something that’s not even relevant to the issue at hand. You’ll reply to said email because it’s a support conversation. They’ll never respond a second time. They will never fix problems they create. They will essentially steal your money with poorly timed system failures and cover ups.  

Love what it could be, not what it is."
kucoin,ios,HgrayO,2,2021-04-01 01:05:36,"I’ve tried several crypto trading platforms and I have a lot to praise KuCoin for but it’s overshadowed by the lack of customer support I’ve experienced. I am new to the app and wasn’t aware that you need a “trading password” to invest in anything. I have no idea what this trading password is (i never made one) and when I ask them to reset it, they don’t accept the photos and information that they require to verify my account. They continue to tell me the reset attempt failed and then ask me to resubmit the info. Beyond frustrated. The trade I wanted to make is already up 50% and days later no one has reached out to provide a solution to the issue. I really hope they revamp their systems soon because they will continue to lose valuable customers."

Their futures allow for an actual proper stop loss and take profit which is essential if you ever want to be a successful trader. HOWEVER. Trading crypto is by far the worst thing you can do for trying to become profitable. Low liquidity and ABYSMAL market structure you will never be able to constantly trade. I hope this will save someone out there from making horrible financial decisions and if you want to trade, find an index or precious metal to trade. You will be WAY better off."

When I was in the process of trading, the app crashed and when I opened it back up, my account had a value of $0. All of my XRP that I had been saving for over a year had evaporated in thin air and I still don’t have an answer for what happened. All I know is that I had my XRP, then their faulty app crashed and I lost everything in my account. 

There’s nothing I can do to get back what was stolen from me but hopefully, I can help others by warning them to prevent them from having everything stolen from them."

But with a little help it’s not hard to learn, but it is a hands on experience and KuCoin provides all the tools and security to become successful. KuCoin has the tools I need to learn to use and with practice I can become proficient. It is God that gives me the power to create wealth. KuCoin is a toolbox I enJOY using."

Not only do they provide a solid trading experience for more advanced traders, but the overall experience on the app is unmatched. Special promotions, futures, easy app navigation, small and micro cap tokens not supported on other exchanges, staking...and the list goes on. Most importantly, KuCoin has been more secure in recent times. Offering things like 2-Factor Authentication really adds to the security of your assets. Great exchange. Great app. Great cryptocurrency experience."
kucoin,ios,Josh_KY,1,2022-01-24 08:22:56,"I signed up and all seemed okay.   I was cruising along buying this and that.   Used the same funding account every time to load USDT.  (Speaking of USDT when I was referred as a new user, I tried to get the sign up bonus but their wording is/was purposely confusing.   I say purposely because I pointed out the grammatical errors and they just ignored me)

Anyway… yeah at first I was having to pay exorbitant fees to load USDT via 3rd party, then they finally verified me and it was 1.02 which was nice.

Then, out of the blue, I go to load $200 via same payment source as before, at same internet IP I always use, and it says “for your safety your trade has been canceled”.  I ask support and they say try a new bank card.   Grrr.   Went to my bank and got a new card.  And voila!! It still does the same thing.   And here I am 2 weeks and several closed tickets later.    

I’ve transferred most of my assets over to my Ledger for the time being.    Proceed with caution and make sure you have an exit strategy.   I was worried they would freeze my funds “for my safety”.

Best of luck!"
kucoin,ios,JNBRWE,5,2021-05-04 04:27:29,An array of coins to choose from. Only thing I can gripe about is.. that it was pretty difficult to learn how to use the app. But after messing around and learning to I became a pro. They have future trading which is definitely a plus. Tips for loading money: use an exchange you can buy crypto on like coinbase or crypto . Com and do a wallet to wallet transfer. I use algorand .. super fast transfer times. Don’t give up on the app.. you’ll figure it out.. If you can’t.. maybe you shouldn’t be trading.. lol
kucoin,ios,mdsnrn,1,2021-12-30 13:47:27,"I’m finally in contact with a group of investors to help bring to light the unethical practices of KuCoin. As an avid trader, I was excited and eager to utilize KuCoin due to their wide array of token offerings and an involved CEO. However, after a few questionable losses, I began having my suspicions about them. Low and behold, they’ve failed to address major “flaws” and are greatly profiting by liquidations. Customer service only responds with generic emails as though I’m an inexperienced trader. However, this is completely the opposite of such. I’m well aware of how this should work on an ethical platform. There’s plenty of articles finally exposing exactly how and what they are doing and can be found on Reddit in the subreddit labeled “Cryptocurrency.” 

Do NOT leave your money with these thieves."

I got angry in the same fashion because this is complicated functionality coupled with highly emotional activity ( risking your hard earned money). Nice work Man taking the time to followup with some kindness and props where they are deserved. There are humans on the other end of these computers too I believe trying to help more often than not. Peace to you, Friend."
kucoin,ios,SR 45,5,2021-10-09 14:13:24,"I downloaded this app and it looks great! Unfortunately, it does not support my country (United States). I found this out after searching specifically for KuCoin Us on the AppStore, signing up for an account and trying to go through KYC. All the best exchanges have no official US support and that’s sad. The rest of the world seems to be a lot more free than we are. Anyways, great product! I Hope to be able to participate someday, when my overlords decide to allow it."
kucoin,ios,TheLukeShort,1,2021-10-21 02:36:46,"I’m on about 15-20 different exchanges and never seen anything freeze like Kucoin does. How on earth do they have the conscience to even charge trading fees when they make you lose your whole portfolio. Their infrastructure is out of date, and their chart freezes every hour making you think it’s one price and it’s another. Refreshing doesn’t help. This isn’t once or twice. This is every day multiple times a day. The concept of the exchange is awesome, and Kucoin could have the world with their good customer service, but until they fix the most vital issue any exchange can have, it’s dangerous to trade on here so stay away. I’ll change my review if it ever changes."
kucoin,ios,Balakay Lee,1,2020-03-31 14:56:17,"KuMex is feels years behind other exchanges, like other new exchanges, in terms of UI and API. The Stop Losses and Take Profits can’t be set on mobile when making an order. Stop Losses will randomly disappear (they claim it’s from modified a Stop Loss.. then why did the new stop loss disappear as well?).

The biggest issue with their service is the manual close on KuMex. If you attempt a market close under critical conditions if a stop loss isn’t met or “changed” the market close MAY not work in order to sever losses and avoid a liquidation. This market is dangerous and any violent movement, like on 3/13, that causes issues with the exchange can cause the UI market close to not execute. You run a very strong risk of losing serious money from this."

It’s my fault, crypto is risky. Just frustrated that they didn’t send me any notification outside of the app that my coins were delisting.  An email to warn users of coins held that might delist would be really nice."

Low gas fees, great charts, a ton of different stable coins and tokens to choose from. It’s completely eliminated the need to jump back and forth from one app to another to keep up with all my investments and favorite crypto. Only problem I’ve had is trying to figure out my average price paid, for now I just keep up with it on a piece of paper ;)"

With all these ways to earn I’d like to suggest the app have a locked crypto feature. For example, the app would give you fake BTC too put into there bots. I know this app has potential but it’s very very hard to learn for beginners even with the tutorials and such."
kucoin,ios,Tinderistheworsttttt,1,2022-11-09 18:14:29,I have been holding my long position for over a year by adding margin. Today I got liquidated because KuCoin for the 3 time this week has ensured to lock us from adding more margin by making sure that crypto contracts are under maintenance as crypto crashes which further exacerbates the crash since they hold all our crypto and also lock us out from adding more margin to ensure we don’t get liquidated. I will make a tiktok and expose you and your company as you have done this several times this week alone and through the years. Good luck this is completely fraudulent and just because you’re in China doesn’t mean you are untouchable.

I tried to buy a token that was newly listed on the app which had a starting price of 10 cents and when I purchased it, it filled at $5400 per coin. Absolutely ridiculous. When I sold, the price was back to 13 cents. All my money gone. I tried to reach out to customer support and after trying for weeks, all they could say was that crypto currencies are based on luck and I was merely dealt a bad hand. In all my years, that had to be the worst customer care service I had ever received. if I could rate the app zero stars, I would."
kucoin,ios,CMilliorn,5,2021-02-18 19:37:27,"This app has had many updates. The UI is slick and the app is smooth. There is solid volume on the coins they offer for trade. The trade fees are significantly less than coin base and the other big name companies. 

Of the bad reviews I read I no longer see the problems they described. Nor do I see any issues with instant price changing like one user suggested.

I am quite happy with the application."

But recently I’ve been having issues with the trading bots feature. Luckily right now I don’t have any money in them, because at least in the app it won’t load and open the feature. It worked a couple months ago but now it won’t.
I’d love if this could get fixed"
kucoin,ios,Onchain Analysis,5,2023-10-22 02:03:04,"One of the very best exchanges in the world, unfortunately completely unavailable to U.S. customers. 
Not sure when this industry will overcome these barriers but when it comes to cutting edge technology and equitable financial services, Kucoin is at the forefront of this trend.  While the United States is isolated from all of its offerings. 
I give Kucoin 5 stars, only wish I could still use it."

Update: new update to the app is awesome! I love the new look and feel! The new games are fun. My only issue still is you guys need to add a PnL chart. If a horrible app like BitMart can do it I would think you guys should have no issues. Please update the app to have some charts! Good work so far otherwise! Keep it up 👍🏻!!

kucoin,ios,EwowBusiness,2,2022-06-15 00:57:06,I have used the app to buy crypto without problems. I cannot trade (or withdraw) because of the trading password which is highly improbable that I don’t know what it would be. I have tried FOUR times to reset the password and after taking 15-20 minutes each time to go through all the steps have been denied four times. I have also been through customer support three times with no resolving this issue. I might like to continue using the KuCoin services but something has to give… will the give be me giving up?
kucoin,ios,Dani panah,4,2022-04-22 20:45:30,"The app overall is great and user friendly. Limited KYC so you don’t feel like they are invading your privacy which is great for crypto.
They just need to add a Stop loss or take profit future as you submit the order. Currently you can only do that after the position has been opened.
your order might get filled and get liquidated all over night, so I suggest canceling orders that haven’t filled before you sleep."
kucoin,ios,beepbopboop2001234,1,2021-09-26 16:53:19,Downloaded this app and moved a few enj coins into it just to make a couple small trades and try it out. Decided to withdraw 50 of them and this app was going to charge me 15 enj lol (that’s worse than coin base fees) I decided to pay the ridiculous fee and just be done with KuCoin but when I tried to confirm the withdrawal it asked me to enter the “trading password” which it never gave me (I tried my log in password (which is the only password that I’m aware of) and I of course was not the “trading password” so I can even withdraw my crypto. Don’t transfer anything to this app. From what I’ve seen they’re just stealing from people.
kucoin,ios,verification needed,1,2022-11-17 12:26:55,"No customer service phone number exists only a email that takes two days to get a response. If you forget your trading password you can submit a change form that takes 1-3 days if approved (mine has failed twice still nothing done about it). then a added 24 hours after your trading password has changed. When asked about the failed applications they told me to submit a ticket about it. KuCoin is a perfect example why people are skeptical about getting into crypto. Total sham. 

Research alternative companies before using Kucoin!"

I will not be doing any more business with KuCoin and I will be telling everyone I meet who is in Crypto not to use it. 

If they even just stopped the outgoing transaction and kept it in house I would be happy, but the two representatives, via email, have said they cannot."

After trying three different web browsers to verify my identity, the support agent pointed me towards the app. But the app proved to be lacking. On an iPad, the login screen didn’t scale properly and was partially cut off. While it fit the screen on my iPhone, it wasn’t taking me down the same pathway that it took the support agent, and thus, my issue was not able to be resolved. 

I can’t even speak to the purchase experience. Hopefully it’s better than their security and verification progress."

It can be very confusing at first and the app seems overwhelming at times but after you play around with the app for a bit everything starts making sense and the layout is actually really nice.  Definitely worth the try. Especially for the bot.
kucoin,ios,Anomster,2,2022-02-11 10:56:35,The previous version of your app was complicated and had a learning curve but it was still useful. The new version your app lacks basic utility. I don’t know to do basic tasks and you’ve instead focused the app on useless and unwanted features. I highly recommend you do some UX research studies with newer crypto investors to improve the product if that is your goal. The only reason I’m giving 2 stars is because you left the option for me to go back to the old interface (oddly hidden within a random emoji)?!
kucoin,ios,Ytor,5,2019-11-01 01:38:06,I have been using KuCoin for over two years now and they have been great. I have never had any issues they could not resolve in a timely manner.

The representatives from KuCoin on the chat never offered any remedy and just keep telling me to patiently wait. They don’t offer to reach out by email or anything. Speaking of email...

When you write in they can never see what happened and see send you info on how to trade futures. They don’t even check your record meaning they do v not have any sort of integrity.

It will not let you login without having a country and region that is supported all the United States location Shows not to be supported so the app is totally useless. You go to customer service they sent you right back to the same page that you just left. It’s automated not very helpful at all. Would not recommend this to anyone."

If you refused to let someone trade why won’t you let them take their money out. They won’t do all necessary verification before you transfer your fund, after fund transfer they’ll block you from getting your fund out and won’t allow you to trade. I need my money back, I will be filing a complaint against law enforcement and I do not understand why Apple is allowing this app to show up to US user. This is fraudulent act."

⚠️WARNING ⚠️ To everyone reading this I have a simple advisory for you.

GO READ THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS ‼️

They are not exaggerating.
I didn’t read the negatives until I joined Kucoin’s platform and started experiencing problems

The negative reviews tells it all.
My story is they robbed me.
My purchases either didn’t show up in my account and my money gone.
Or my purchase did show up and was gone out of my account the next day.
I was fine while I only had 2 assets purchased but the moment I bought 3 more assets they started robbing my account as if 5 was too many for me to keep up with."

What’s going on?  I’ve never seen a candle disappear and reappear later.  Over and over all day.  Development team should look into it.  Unless that’s  what you’re trying to do.  I like this app when it works in real-time.  Weird right?

I made $600 and my trading fee was like $30 , I was like ok that’s fine. When I would lose a trade, which everybody loses. You can’t win everything. Let’s say I lose $60, my trading fees are $30. What is this? I lose 120 , my trading fees are 180. How am I supposed to be successful trader if my loses are amplified by 30% or more. How can a trading fee for losing be that much?

But for making quick trades on highly speculative assets this app is a life saver thank you devs please keep on improving there’s lots of work to be done!
kucoin,ios,MikeTwiss,1,2020-06-21 18:49:30,"This app KuCoin is a scam. They are taking money from folks who are doing contract trading. They incorporate ways to make you have to liquidate your balance without any way to prevent it. Stop loss doesn’t work properly, and they will stop you from market orders etc. as soon as you need it most. (During volatility). 

They are also involved in a case where they are being sued for scamming users and they are not regulated by the proper financial oversight organizations. 

Don’t use this app. Apple needs to take this app down off of the App Store ASAP. This Kucoin company will disallow trust in this App Store."

kucoin,ios,Mr.Penz,3,2020-06-15 16:17:39,"Hello,

I love the KuCoin application, it’s fast and the user interface is easy to learn and navigate. I like the fact that KuCoin makes it easy for me to pay for crypto with my debit card and the deposit is almost instant. However, I gave the mobile application a 3 star because it requires access to the photos stored on your phone to be able to buy crypto with fiat. This is a major turn off, there’s no reason for KuCoin to ask permissions to my photo album for me to buy crypto. I bypass this by going on their website using a PC, but it’s massively inconvenient. If they remove the need for the app to access my photo albums when trying to purchase crypto with my debit\credit card, I’ll update the rating to a 5 star.

Beat regards,
Yancarlos"

I was left with $14! I REALLLYY wish i could post images because I know this is hard to believe.

It took me another hour or so to figure out to buy and trade. Bad, just bad all around."

I will be withdrawing all my money soon. It also keeps saying that I am posting from Facebook each time I open it, which means it is reading my activities on my phone and capturing data without permission. Why would a company want to handle millions of dollars buy lack proper technology infrastructure!"

I can’t wait till they have a class action lawsuit against KuCoin and they will mark my words."

All support is thru email or chat. Then I wonder if regulations or not should be better to this exchanges. Funny what make the unique is the same thing that make you wonder.

Well they like to print out these random tokens and use them as collateral to borrow against them. So fake magic money going in the market and then they move the market to their advantage to take your funds. Something tells me they are insolvent but we will see in the next couple months.

kucoin,ios,Mobsterrr Warrsss,1,2021-02-11 16:16:03,You’ll pay for coins but you won’t get any. And once you contact them then they’re going make up a reason and refund you the money. I’m sure they get away with keeping peoples money. To make a payment it redirects you to a company that no body has ever herd of and that’s shady. Why not take money directly from your platform? I have a feeling even if someone does get coins from kucoin they won’t be able to cash them out.

kucoin,ios,TVRtyler,1,2021-11-07 18:22:42,"I wouldn't go so far as to call KuCoin a ""scam"" but it's pretty close. The withdraw fees that they charge are almost theft. $35 fee to withdraw any amount of USDT. 800,000 SHIB fee to withdraw any amount of SHIB. 0.005 BTC fee to withdraw any amount of BTC. And it goes on and on.  It is pretty ridiculous. 

Then there is the fact that I've lost over $300 in withdraws that never arrived in the wallets they were sent too, even though the addresses were LITERALLY copy and pasted. 

The fees are %100 my fault because I obviously did not read the fine print well enough. The disappearance of money in withdraws gets nowhere with KuCoin support, as you'd expect. 

Do your due diligence if you're going to use this app."

All you can do is look at candlesticks, but you can't draw trendlines like most other exchange apps. If these functions are added then the app would be a solid 5 stars! Update: still no trendlines and I’ve also noticed they don’t have trailing stop losses either. Downgrade to 1 star. If they add trendlines and stop losses it’s a 5 star app."

I had an issue where all of a sudden my trading passcode didn’t work while I was in some futures contracts. Changed the passcode 3 times trying to get it to work with no success.

All my positions were liquidated as I sat there watching unable to close a trade. KuCoin customer service blamed me and didn’t remedy the situation.

Don’t just take my word for it though - a quick google search will show you all types of ways they steal their customers money.

Wonderful... The best trading app ever. Very fast and reliable. God! Your app rock.  This app is pretty solid as far as functionality and ease of use, but I do have something I would REALLY like to see changed… So when a person checks their orders, either the open or filled ones, the small cryptos need to have the decimal extended two more places or so and not rounded to the penny. Some cryptos like DOGE and XLM trade in hundredths of pennies (IE .2577) so it would be nice to see the exact amount listed on the orders. I may have a few orders placed in the .25 range, so it’s difficult to find a specific order in that range when they all just say .25. I would assume this has to be a pretty easy fix. I also have another suggestion that would be helpful to me and I’m sure to others… It would be a VERY nice feature to be able to set up price alert pushes or at the very least to receive a push notification when one of our orders is filled. I would definitely give this app 5-stars if the above suggestions were implemented. In fact, I would even pay a subscription fee to be able to have push notifications. I’m not sure if there is a fee for Kucoin to send out push notifications, but if there is a fee, it can’t be much as I can get multiple push notifications on the scores of my favorite teams (or even the entire NFL slate of games) from free sports apps. That would be really neat... All bug with new upload are fixed!! Great!!!!"

My phone is iphone 5s and ios 12.5.4 is installed. There's a bug in ios app. In futures screen when scrolling down the app, the screen goes down/up rapidly. However, in normal trading screen everything is O.K.

kucoin,ios,Liljmia,5,2021-05-05 19:11:16,"Read the reviews and you’ll quickly notice a common theme.. user error and inexperience. Some guy complaining about bitcoin transfer not showing up 45 minutes later... bitcoin transactions can take an hour, sometimes more. Depends on the fee you paid to send and how busy the network is. You obviously never sent btc before. Another guy playing with margin, which is basically gambling by borrowing using your assets/crypto as collateral. You’re playing a dangerous game playing with margin, because you’re liable for losses when the market dips. You’re trying to make a profit by GAMBLING that the price will go up. If it doesn’t and you lose a certain percentage, the asset automatically sells itself to cover losses. This guy went ALL IN with more than he was comfortable losing, that’s YOUR FAULT! Why not just let your coins sit and grow? He lost his coins because the market dipped. You don’t play with that, it’s not because the app closed. That’s dishonest interpretation of what happened. This is exchange has been awesome so far. It’s not the A-tier exchanges like Binance or Coinbase, but it’s a solid B. The A-tier exchanges simply have more volume pumping through them, but in terms of usability and utility, ease of use, etc I give KuCoin an A+. Ppl who have left negative reviews are ALL mostly new to this space, chasing fomo, and they CLEARLY don’t understand this game yet. KuCoin has security hold protocols in place, especially for new users to avoid fraud. They don’t let you move assets right away when you make changes to your email or change a password, that lasts 24 hours or so. It gives the owner a chance to react to security alert emails/texts if anyone were to gain access to your account. These are smart moves to protect your account, crying about it just shows inexperience. I love KuCoin. It’s a great exchange for US investors. It’s not technically set up for US yet, but it doesn’t prevent us from investing. The only limitation is that you’re limited to withdrawing 2 btc per day, and for most ppl that’s plenty given we’re not all moving $120k per day!! Too much complaining from ppl who need to look at their own mistakes, and blame their own lack of knowledge/research. Taking crazy chances like that dude who gambled with $12k of xrp on margin, and then complaining when he crappped out. That’s your own fault!"

kucoin,ios,˖°🦇ִ ࣪𖤐,5,2022-08-28 05:42:21,"Crypto over the years has become too invasive when it comes to buying, selling, trading. Every time you want to buy off an exchange they ask for loads of information and copies of personal identifiers, just for them to hold your funds for weeks until the transfer is confirmed. The trading limits and fees are outrageous sometimes so it makes you think, what’s the point? Well KuCoin brings back all the great features that we used to have back in the day. You can trade, buy, withdraw INSTANTLY!!! No waiting for days or your account getting locked up for “security reasons”!!! KuCoin is the top exchange to use and they have such an amazing team that actually cares about their product & services. There are many similar to KuCoin but there really is only one like it and that’s being them ONLY. Give them a shot and you will see why they are leagues better than Coinbase, Kraken, etc. They also have their own NON-Custodial wallet with plenty of top of the line security, they offer staking & lending of popular coins, & you can trade with the lowest fees ever. Take back control of your assets and stop waiting forever and ever for other exchanges just for them to eventually bar your from your own assets. It’s been happening to the mightiest of exchanges so always be on the lookout and always remember, NOT YOUR KEYS THEN IT REALLY ISN’T YOUR CRYPTO. Use exchanges for buying & selling only, immediately send your assets to a secured wallet and keep your funds in COLD STORAGE. Stay safe and happy trading!!"

At first I thought maybe my timing was bad, but every single trade I took the same result would happen, and if I waited to see if it would move before getting in, it would act like it was going to go my way, so then I’d buy in and then boom it would immediately try to liquidate me, seemed awfully sketchy to me as a bunch of people I’ve talked to have had the same issue.  Also when I went to remove my money from the account out of frustration, it wouldn’t let me sell my USDC for USD, saying that I wasn’t verified, even though I had submitted a verification.  I contacted support and I was told that I was verified and that I shouldn’t have any issues.  I tried to tell them the app was literally telling me I wasn’t verified and that it had been rejected, but they never responded, so I opened a new ticket and got the same response, “you’re verified, you should be able to sell” and never received any help.  I finally managed to get my money out only after moving my USDS out of KuCoin, transferring it into my Coinbase wallet, in which KuCoin charged me almost $30 in fees to move $240 out of my account.  Only once I got it to Coinbase was I able to sell it for USD, and finally get my money back to my bank account.

kucoin,ios,ITABWODI,1,2021-05-10 11:58:39,"Update: Changing to one star because tech support closed my ticket without solving my issue. They seem to have an automated ticket system that failed to acknowledge several of my email responses. I think I was able to finally get a message through to the system after they marked it as solved, but I now have little confidence that I’ll get any more help on my issue. 

I’m sort of a newbie to crypto trading, but I started using KuCoin to trade some X Y O that I mined in another app.  The KuCoin iOS (iPhone) app works fine.  All of the features function as described, and I have never experienced a crash or lost currency due to any malfunctions.  I’ve lost on bad trades, but that’s another story.  My biggest problem with the iOS app is size of the text.  They try to cram so much info onto the screen that the text get’s really small and hard to read.  SO, I decided to try the iPadOS version of the app on my 2020 iPad Pro.  The text is definitely easier to read, but the app only works in portrait view.  It will not rotate to landscape.  In that sense, it feels very much like an iPhone app that was hastily ported to iPad format.  Also, and this is the biggest issue for me, the trading bot simply does not work on the iPad.  I have waited weeks for responses from tech support, and the answer is simply to reinstall the app and try again.  I’ve tried that a number of times with no success.  All I get is an error message that it failed to load. I would really like to see landscape mode with full screen charts (like the website) on the iPad app, and it would good to get the bot working on the iPad.  If they do that, I’ll revise my rating."

kucoin,ios,John Crews,3,2021-08-07 16:43:00,"As a result of having an apparently “jailbroken phone”, I am not allowed to access the app via my mobile phone. I have NEVER used the website through a PC to place any trades, deposits - anything! I am accustomed to the mobile app, I like the mobile app and I will ONLY use the mobile app. At this point, unfortunately, I will be leaving the KuCoin platform. There was a time just weeks ago where I thought that this was the best cryptocurrency exchange that existed. Now? Due to this very, very annoying issue that should not even be existent, I am no longer a fan or supporter of KuCoin. I’ll be leaving the Reddit community and any other forum/platform/exchange associated in any way with the company.

I want to add that, particularly through Reddit, I have been an avid supporter of the platform. I’ve even had several short conversations with Johnny KuCoin who is the CEO of the company. He’s a very nice man and has always put my interest first in amending any problems I have had - which admittedly are rare. Upon emailing the company today though? I was given a response that essentially, in other words, said “oh well, you can’t use your phone I guess! Go buy a laptop and use our exchange through our website.”

This is a joke. Please, fix the problem or you lie at risk of losing supportive members of your community - the community you have worked tirelessly to build! 

I hope that Johnny_Kucoin sees this message. I hope that someone steps up to resolve the issue before KuCoin loses its ground to stand on. I checked social media and I am not the only person with the problem. As a matter of fact - and although I didn’t read them all - I picked through lists of articles/forum topics surrounding this dilemma that must have been numbered in the hundreds, if not thousands!

This is something that should be at the TOP of the priority list and I hope that KuCoin is able to prove why they are so beloved by the cryptocurrency trading community. Thank you for your time spent in reading this message. I know it was long but I wanted to make sure that all of the information given was clear. I look forward to hearing back from you as well as seeing this issue resolved.

kucoin,ios,BootyRay,3,2023-11-08 10:15:36,"I really enjoy this app and it serves as a great tool for interacting with cryptocurrency. Buying, selling, trading,swapping, withdrawals, deposits. Hundreds, maybe thousands of cryptocurrencies available too.

In the last two years they’ve done a phenomenal job improving the application, however there is still a lot of improvements that could be made regarding leveraged futures trading. More specifically, cryptocurrencies marked as “HOT” within the leveraged futures on KuCoin.

There is often times a significant misrepresentation of the cryptocurrency’s price when buying “HOT” leveraged futures positions, and occasionally selling them too on “best market price”. To make matters worse, if you do try to “Limit” (buy/sell) there’s been times where I am unable to even place a buy limit because the system is under the impression I will auto-liquidate when I’ve calculated the risk and added proper margin. Also, I’ve been completely unable to sell as if the system thinks there’s no liquidity. 

This has been an issue for quite some time. I’d like to see this addressed and a “Risk Percentage” indicator added to each Leveraged Future position, which determines your current risk tolerance based on your leveraged amount (1X, 5X, etc.,) margin ratio, and/or total margin added onto the position with consideration to cryptocurrency’s price.

Kucoin does want to better protect users from these issues. A small risk indicator may help users have a different perspective of their risk of liquidating without having to guess how much more margin is required to reach a specific liquidation price. 

For example, if I have a position that is close to liquidating, the “Risk %” would be close to 100%. Then, I may choose to add in more margin, but before I “confirm” and the money is taken from my balance, I could see the “Risk %” would be pushed back closer to 0%. 

Thanks,
Wirb on Kucoin"

kucoin,ios,D.F.R. III,1,2021-05-10 20:58:07,"I have NEVER written up a review for an app but I felt I had to, not because I want to.

TL;DR: Fix your 401 Network connection issues!! I lose money because I can’t close positions if I can’t connect and therefore can’t recommend!!!

Before I joined the app I shopped around to make sure the exchange/app was reliable and was a good experience. I saw raving reviews and was thoroughly impressed with how they handled the situation when they got hacked a few years ago. So I downloaded the app and signed up.

Initially the app is a confusing experience and not user friendly. However, as you navigate the app and spend more time in it the app makes more sense. The app and platform was a real 5 stars for me and I was recommending it to friends. I noticed however that every once in a while I would get 401 Errors or Network Connection issues. This happened sporadically and wasn’t game breaking.

What brings the app down to a 1 star is the fact that these errors have gotten worse and more pervasive even as I tried to “improve” my connection. I would try going to areas with better reception, no luck. I would restart the app, works maybe 20% of the time. I would restart my phone, works once and then stops working after you load the app again.

I had a position that, while risky, I was aware that it could have been liquidated. KuCoin sent me a message saying I was in danger of getting liquidated as the position had dropped. Great, but I couldn’t get do anything in the app to respond as it couldn’t  connect even though I had service. By the time I got on, through my computer, my position had already been liquidated and I lost all of my money. 

It has gotten so bad that I’m now not just considering but will move to a different platform. Fix it please, I really like the platform but the connection issues make it absolutely unusable and unreliable. Time is money and these connection issues cost me a lot of time and money.

Other issues include: Slow 2FA SMS, can’t go through KYC to unlock rest of features, missing features or not well explained, and generally slow loading times."
kucoin,ios,brandonwolford,1,2022-12-13 12:19:51,"I’ve used pretty much every trading app out there and have been trading crypto for several years now. Of all the trading apps this one is by far the shadiest and I assume just preys on people who don’t understand the difference between limit and market orders. 

Whenever I place a limit order the purchase order will fill 1% + every single time. This basically means they are skimming (stealing) 1% on every order. This may not seem like a lot but keep in mind that if you use margin, say 20x you are already -20% as soon as your order fills. This is the first way I noticed this app stealing from me. The second way was on stop losses. 

The stop loss feature is labeled just that. It is not labeled a Limit Stop Loss. Multiple times my trigger price would hit and the stop loss would not trigger at which point I was liquidated shortly after. I split test this and it happened multiple times. 

The final way this platform robbed me was when I tried to get my money off the exchange and back to my Binance account. The transfer out would not and still will not go through after multiple attempts. Again, I’m not ignorant to trading and crypto wallet / platform transfers. This app isn’t having errors it’s designed to do all of these things and I’m sure scrapes millions per week from users who don’t understand functions. 

Lastly when I inquire for help all I get is automated responses that are absolutely useless and don’t even add the inquiry. Luckily I only moved like 1k over here to try it out simply because they had some very low cap projects I was interested in but that’s still a 1k loss now even though I didn’t loose it trading. Please don’t use with extreme caution and don’t move any funds over here you’re not willing to flush down the toilet. Even if you make a good investment and do well you probably won’t be able to transfer funds out."

They manipulate their charts and their prices not to mention the percentage increase or decrease for 24 hour periods most of their contracts are front running especially their KuCoin smart chain House token. 

Don’t even get me started on their futures or margin trading. Let’s just put it this way any money you put in there do not expect to get back. It is specifically designed to make sure that you withdraw zero money. The futures market or downright criminal. I’ve been trading futures for over 20 years very successfully seeing as it’s part of my career, and I’ve never seen anything as efficient as this app for robbing you of your money. Their liquidation engine is literally just a bought that tracks your orders and what it would take to liquidate you and even if you close out in a profitable spot you will come up negative. 100% of the time.

 These guys are a Hong Kong headquartered company, these Chinese nationals will steal your money and there’s nothing you can do about it. I have also had a referral of mine lose $250,000 because they locked him out of his account. $250K gone because they wanted to take it. 

I have several videos of questionable, at best, price action & also have several screenshots & testimony from a close friend who lost $250K trying to talk to customer service to get money back. I can verify anything & everything that I have said here with pictures, correspondence from KuCoin, and verification on block chain. 

Do yourself a favor especially if you are a US citizen, do not put any money in this exchange. Unless you want to lose it. Anybody you see you leaving a positive review of more than one star on this app is definitely a fake review from one of these Chinese nationals “Working” at KuCoin to steal your money. These guys are subhuman scum, don’t do them the service of giving them your money. United States citizens are making these exchange owners deca billionaires from how much money they are taking from us. It’s not a joke do your research thank me later. Trust me you will thank me."

kucoin,android,Monday March,1,2025-01-29 10:43:04,"""Hello kucoin, I humbly request that you consider adding a new feature, 'Halal Trading', which adheres to Islamic principles and prohibits interest (usury). This would enable Muslim users, who make up approximately 23% of the global population, to participate in crypto trading without compromising their faith. As you may know, Islamic law prohibits Riba (interest), which is a significant barrier for Muslim traders We will be very Thankful to you😊"

crypto.com,ios,Jean Johnson laura,5,2025-02-16 10:45:24,"Please be wary of the many scam investment website everywhere, Sometimes in November I lost about 48 BTC and 986,000 worth of USDT to a fake MT5 trading platform. I got lured to this trading platform with the intent to earn 15percent of my investment in each trade I thought it was a good trading platform not knowing they were sneaky and manipulating to take away all my funds. After weeks of being sad I found the best cryptocurrency recovery pundit phantomHackerX0X (at) gmail. Com Whom I hired and spoke with their support team about my situation. They requested for some certain information and they swing into actions immediately. To my surprise within hours they were able to trace and track my stolen funds then subsequently they recover each and every penny of my money back to me without hassle or hidden charges. This is the best recovery specialist to hire to recover all your stuck, missing or scammed funds and digital assets. They are the real deal send a detailed email to this team at phantomHackerX0X (at) gmail. Com, they’re extremely the best I’ll urge you to reach out to him on his email to solve any related issues, I recommend Global hack any where because he did what I didn’t expect.. I’ll urge you to reach out to him on his gmail if you have any similar issue, thank you!"
crypto.com,ios,Bobby de Ortega,5,2022-11-12 23:25:11,"Out of all the Crypto exchanges out there, this is the one that clearly stands out due to their professionalism and consistent high-quality experiences to include this app. Over the last few years I have done business with several Centralized Exchanges and this one happens to be my favorite due to their privacy practices, stable experiences and tight customer service. If ever I had a question related to my investments they were quick to answer. Not only that, they have taken proactive steps to ensuring secure practices. With all of that said I would also highly-recommend that anyone reading this review to also consider a “cold storage” solution if they want even more control and security over their investments. Also, seriously do your homework in this space as there is a lot to learn and—at times—peril. Inform yourself, take calculated risks (or don’t) and mitigate any unnecessary risk or lack of security that you can. This space is both promising and relatively new and will not go away by virtue of the follies of some of the less mature characters out there. 

Excellent app, thank you."
crypto.com,ios,crypto jj,1,2022-02-18 13:39:08,"This app started great, it has many good features like the airtime pay for cellphone service that you can use with the Crypto that your holding. The downfall happened to me recently after securing the account with 2fa. In the beginning of the account security it was great, transfer went smooth, but then there was a attack on CRYPTO last month that caused some disturbances resulting in a 2fa reset forcing certain users to apply this change. Since this was done for me already it didn’t bother me until I went to transfer funds to discover the 2fa was not accurate. This is where the problem started. I contacted customer service and the bot spat out a inaccurate solution resulting in me texting a random agent that request that I submit a video for “security” reasons. After providing said video, it was not good enough, so I have to change email address to “secure” the account. I thought it was over until I get another email saying “he he hee” we need another video of glycine hiding a ransom sign. Now the crypto card I have is frozen and this is still a ongoing issue.

Update: In order to Get back into the account I had to literally submit 8 MORE VIDEOS!!! Keep in mind that it’s in a UNSECURE EMAIL, which means your identity will be compromised by another party to be used without your knowledge. This is a Major concern of mine and with the current trend I’m not sure if I will be victimized by this FORCED “security” policy.

Again beware….."
crypto.com,ios,Tommyloansu,1,2021-06-09 22:15:50,"I’m an Admin in a trading group and we all share different ideas and alert each other of apps that steal your money.  This APP is horrible!!!!  On this app I had most of my money in ALGO (Algorand).  It took a nice 20% increase and I went to go take the profits and move them to CRO.  MAGICALLY my ability to trade was stopped!  I contacted them, took screen shots,  let them know what was going on and that I was losing my profits by the second….  They responded saying it would be fixed later.  Not “let us trade it where you need it or anything of the sort”. They waited until it dropped all the way down to what I bought it at!  Then had the audacity to say, and I quote ”. Thanks for the reply. I totally understand, however, the issue was resolved and you were able to withdraw the funds.
If you have additional questions do not hesitate to get back to us.”   They basically said screw you the same way Robin Hood app does. Scams.   COINBASE and COINBASE PRO is the way to go.  DO NOT GET SCAMMED WHEN YOU SHOULD BE MAKING MONEY!  Again, do not use this app.  Buy rates are always off compared to the actual market and always in their favor.  They say on these reviews “contact us and we’ll look into it” but they just blow you off once they scam you.  You buy for more than the market and sell for less and they don’t let you sell if your currency you’ve put money in pumps.  I wish I could put negative stars instead of one."
crypto.com,ios,Sxmjdushsb,2,2025-01-21 12:16:39,"It’s astonishing how horrible the user interface is. My first thoughts along with others before me is the app is intentionally confusing. They don’t offer candle charts. Only a line chart. It’s fine if they dont offer any indicators at all but they literally don’t offer moving averages..they need a horizontal line on the chart to compare current price to past price. You cannot look at past price & current price at the same time since they take up the same space which makes me constantly think the current price is different than what it actually is. The worst thing to me besides no moving averages is (to my disbelief) THE CONSTANT POP UP ADS! This app is 90% ADS!! even when I disable them I’m still getting pop up ads telling me to bet my money on sports & etc.. WTH. Also I hate brokerage apps that are filled with more words than numbers. I literally hate this app & it gives me headaches & a given up heart knowing this is the app imma stick to because of their low fees. The web app is broken & doesn’t show price averages. The only good thing is their customer support section ironically enough. You can close it & open it up & continue conversations on your own time whenever you’d like which is awesome. If you just add a horizontal line, simple moving averages & stop the pop up ads I would have way less complaints about this app."
crypto.com,ios,Justin Bayc,1,2023-11-10 15:36:04,"I’ve had an account with these guys for over two years. I pulled a good amount of money out at the end of the last bull run, but left a few hundred bucks in to play with some smaller coins. I would check in like once every 6 months just to see where things are at and all’s been good. Price action was slow so I didn’t feel the need to make an trades. Now things have awakened in the market so I got excited and I went to sign in. Verified my identity like normal. Get to the Home Screen and bam. $0.00 across the board on all assets…… completely gone. Thankfully I only had a few hundred bucks in there but imagine if I hadn’t pulled out my thousands of dollars from before. It would JUST. BE. GONE. I’ve reached out to customer service but it is very automated and getting any meaningful responses to what I would consider is a severe problem has been met with no answers, concern, or general interest to them. Why are all my assets wiped off completely? Even if the markets fell off there would be a few Pennies in there. Transaction history wiped. I have emails proving buys of certain assets and confirmations. But for some reason that evidence doesn’t concern this company AT ALL. I cannot and will not ever recommend this platform. I don’t want to seem like a shill for other platforms but I think your money is safer in literally any other platform or exchange. Can’t believe it. Zero stars."
crypto.com,ios,Fosejo,2,2022-01-27 12:46:59,"At the beginning, I was happy with this app it is a nice app in the sense that you can earn additional income from owning the different crypto assets. The only issue and the biggest issue that I have is that when I try to make purchases with my debit card, it’s a hit and miss and more often than not It is a miss. When I try to make a purchase some of the times it will go through most of the times it doesn’t go through and the issue is not my bank it is the application. I tried to go through their customer service, but their best advice was to transfer money to the application. What if I don’t want to transfer money, I want to use my debit card so I can purchased the crypto as I go along. Also,If you have a customer that is telling you there’s an issue with a certain part of the application why not try to resolve the issue instead of telling them to not use that part of the application and do their purchases a different way. Overall, yes I do like the application, but I get frustrated very often with it because of the fact that I cannot make my purchases that easily. When I started using the application, all my purchases were going through nice and easy but now I do not know what it is that they did and it is just not that easy. Hope you improve this app and make it work the proper way."
crypto.com,ios,$cashguy$,4,2021-08-25 19:03:14,"So far I am very new to this app, however from what I’ve experienced, most of the negative reviews are from beginners that did not take the time to read and understand what they were getting themselves into. I currently have the jade green card and I can say that I have already received my Netflix rebate so that works. I have not tried to withdraw my funds yet as I’m waiting on my money to transfer so I can test everything, however I have spend money with the virtual card and got my money back in cro that way as well. So far it has done everything it should. Also, I have experienced one problem with my card info not displaying on one of my devices however the customer support has been great and they are working on it. If you find yourself with that problem, I would recommend trying a different device if possible. In the end customer support has been kind and respectful and if you take the time to understand the fees that this app should help you earn some serious cash. In the end, just do test payments and be 100% sure of what should happen and be patient. I just hope that they get a website working and one point, other than that I am happy with what I have :)"
crypto.com,ios,Agugz,1,2022-06-14 14:21:16,"UPDATE: I have been in contact with the Crypto support team. It is the absolute worst! Now, every time I send an email asking them the status of my money, this is the response I get:”We are awaiting an update from our dedicated team.  As soon as we have an update, we will let you know.”  BTW, this has been going for over one week!!  When I used to transfer money from my account to Crypto, it took a couple of seconds. There were no issues at all. Now getting my money from Crypto has become the biggest headache!  I REGRET downloading this app!

I have been trying to withdraw my money from Crypto into my bank account. They use Plaid to connect to your financial institution. For some reason, Plaid throws an error message stating ‘Something went wrong. Please try again later’. This has been going on for a few days. Crypto support says the issue is with Plaid, and they can’t give me Plaid support contacts. When I got with Plaid, they say to contact Crypto. I have done all the troubleshooting steps Crypto told me to do, and still doesn’t work. But surprisingly, there’s absolutely no issues using Plaid to withdraw money from my bank account and sending it to Crypto. No error messages there. But trying to get my money from Crypto to my bank account somehow, miraculously doesn’t work. Crypto is basically now telling me there’s nothing they can do about it!!!"
crypto.com,ios,#j-wat,4,2021-09-09 15:57:47,"I really like using this app to trade cryptos because it is fast and has great coverage of many coins out there. I think it is shady that there’s a magic “premium” added to coins when BTC is rising, and this is a money grab in my opinion because that premium is not applied when you sell. For example, CRO was .1210 when I tried to buy, and after doing the math (which is not provided because they know it’s shady) my average cost was somewhere around .125. Not a huge difference but that is hard earned profit by this point. I have been trying to get my CRO card for weeks now and I have been told that the only way I can continue with my application is to provide a picture of my SSN card. This was due to me moving addresses multiple times in the past few years because I am a college student. It is very frustrating and the support, albeit responds in a timely manner, does not seem like they really want to get you to your end goal. With all that said, I still trade here and love checking in on my cryptos. Unfortunately, after my staking period WHICH IS DUMB BECAUSE I DID NOT EVEN RECEIVE A CARD is over I will be transferring my balance to coin base or some other more reliable system."

Also it’s said buying at true cost, but the fees hidden on exchange from trading a coin. Was not easy to find costs ahead of time for me at least. It is easy on and off for through ACH with Chase bank, had trouble with 2 other smaller banks limited to 1k and 5k transfers, chase allows 25k, once I did a withdrawal and had no issue. They just now opened up US to use a separate program to exchange tokens ( coins), so should be less expensive fees in trading and remember you will pay transfer fees to other crypto wallets ( called gas fees), but the coins moved dictate the amount, due your research before trading to check tax consequences for each and every transaction, can be a nightmare! I gave app 4 stars, over all better that Coinbase as far as I’m concerned. Look at there debit card choices, nice options and rewards. Other features are nice like staking stable coins, however they just announced a reduction in interest in staking those. Overall great company, growing leaps and bounds"

I've heard my whole life ""pay yourself first"" but that amounted to impulse buys for more junk I simply don't need, burying me in useless detritus I can never find when I need it 'cause it's buried under other just as useless rubble!  Buying crypto gives me that endorphin hit I desire without increasing the amount of stuff soffocating my very existence.  It's also hitting that betting urge and at much better odds then any casino.  Advice,  buy for the long term, only spend free money that you would've wasted on something mundane.  I started by buying 20,000 shares of VET @.02 cents ea. It's now at about,07, buts been as high as .11, I have no doubt that future readers of this review will look back on these figures and wish they bought in while it was so undervalued.

Once you understand the “flow” of the app, like how to send crypto, it made sense and builds a lot of trust in the user. It is near impossible to send crypto to a wrong wallet, it simplifies the “bridge” to the off exchange wallet functions, it make it easy to add and subtract fiat from bank to bank. It does a lot of different thing well. And with less restriction like daily limits and what not. A lot better than some of the other apps like coinbase and the like. Yes there is a learning curve so on a scale of 1-5, one being cash app simple of just see bitcoin buy bitcoin, to 5 being the full exchange with stop losses, shorts, leverage trading etc, this is a 3. Almost like a gateway into the more complex trading dex’es. I love and enjoy all of the extra added functions and information like the average cost of investment and so on.

So I can’t fund my account or get a response to what is the issue, they will keep saying contact support and would love to take a closer look at your problem but I know even then I probably won’t get a response or a resolution and at this point I am just waiting for my term in crypto earn to pass so I can transfer all my crypto to another app.

Updated, they said “rest assured support will contact you “ yes they did contact me, they told me they are having 0 issues on their side and that I need to try alternative options to deposit funds on my account. Guess what? The alternative options require fees and are not instant except for Apple Pay to instantly buy crypto with fees. I also noticed the price differences on there vs other apps, they do have significant differences in their favor, so those are like more hidden fees. Just you are better off using any other app."

CDC has been very very shady the past few months. They change huge polices over night, multiple times a month, and without notice. At least recently. You can’t trust them. Don’t fall into the trap too of getting one of their cards because they can slash those rates overnight (as they did) and then “upgrade it” slightly to make it seem like they’re doing you a favor lol look up some of their Reddit forums and you’ll see how much of the community, especially a lot of their older loyal investors, have been screwed over lately. You can’t trust these guys because they don’t communicate ANY changes they’re going to make. Or if they do by chance, they’ll enact it days before the announced date just to throw everyone for a loop and screw them up that way. The only people who will try to convince you that CDC is still good are the people who invested more than they can afford to lose in CRO (their crypto). They’re afraid if CDC goes down, CRO will go down and they’ll lose money. My advice is to use coinbase instead. Never had any problems with them. CDC also recently reversed transactions when people were trading and making profits!! Look it up and be careful with this app/company."

They locked my account and made me jump through hoops to get it unlocked, (sending at least 10 different selfies, stating pics were too far, too close etc. and some other steps.) when I regained access the majority of my tokens/coins were gone. I made them aware of the missing coins/tokens and they said they would investigate it. Again, they made me jump through hoops to start the investigative process. (Again with the selfies and other steps etc.) After a few days they sent me an email and said, there are no abnormalities with your account, we concluded you are responsible for the missing coins/tokens. Very strange since they informed me there was unusual activity with my account and locked it. I wasn’t even aware of it. I guess they didn’t want to replace the tokens/coins or admit they were hacked, who knows. I filed complaints with the SEC and FTC. So be careful with this App. Not a very good experience for me."

I was able to deposit money on my Crypto account from my debit card pretty smoothly. Taking money out is pretty straight forward as long as your bank is on the list of compatible banks (which are big name banks and credit unions) I have a very small credit union so I had to open a bank account that was on that list. Pretty common with most app involving bank linking. The only thing I would like to be improved is faster customer service. They will always help you and resolve your issues but you just got to have patience. I understand because of the increased interest in Crypto which increases customers which inevitably increases issues. That being said...customer service response time: ⭐️⭐️⭐️. customer service helpfulness/problem resolution ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️. Platform and navigation through app ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️. Information and transparency ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️. Anyway I love this app so far and I think you should give it a chance. I will leave an updated review 60 days from now."

Specifically, the average cost basis should provide users with an ongoing calculation that considers adjustments for purchases, sales, transfers, and crypto earnings, allowing them to see their average investment per share over time. The total cost basis would encompass all investment transactions, including fees, giving users a comprehensive view of their financial outlay.

Furthermore, the overall yearly, five/ten year, and total years performance metrics should reflect the percentage change in value since the initial investment, factoring in both realized and unrealized gains or losses. For example, for annual performance, we could provide a year-over-year analysis highlighting their investments' performance relative to benchmarks, helping users identify trends and make informed decisions. These functionalities would significantly enhance user engagement by delivering valuable insights into their investment metrics and improving their overall experience with the app."

Absolutely ridiculous! Your guys system is terrible! You should verify the people IN ORDER! That’s what good customer service is! There is no reason I should still be waiting for approval if my friends were approved that fast!

So now I have yet another friend who downloaded the app and was approved in 15 minutes!!! You guys need to get organized because this is just terrible!!! Not to mention the fact I have now contacted y’all through the app 3 times and have emailed y’all numerous times now! No response! No help! No anything! Email me back and verify my account please!

Now After a few days I finally got a response to my email. You know what it said!? To reply to their response if I needed help and they would email me back within 24 hours as a priority. They never emailed me back when I replied!? What kind of customer service is this?????? Is this what you guys do?

crypto.com,ios,Cam748282,1,2024-12-02 18:59:51,"This app has a massive spread on it. They don’t say there is hidden fees and deny it when pressed about it. They overcompensate the spreads so they gain money on your trade when you buy and sell.

For example: you buy a crypto for $1 on their app and you want to sell that crypto immediately. Now you can only sell that crypto for $0.90 but the chart and prices are still the same. They are scamming you. Pick a better app that has a lower spread ( i think Binance is much lower). In this same situation on another app you may buy something for $1.00 and will be able to sell it immediately for about $.97.

This app also doesn’t have bar charts, live data, and you can only see the buy + sell spread after purchase. Their unrealized gains are inaccurate and lead you to believe you are up more than you actually are (they don’t base it off the sell price). For example I had an unrealized gain of $40 on the chill guy stock (i only bought it for $50) and almost doubled my money on it. I went to sell (and didn’t realize the large spread) and after i confirmed my sell order I actually only had profited $11. So i stead of $90 i was lead to believe I only came away with $61. I hope somebody with money sets up a clash action against these scammers."

Enjoyed using the app and learned a lot. I have found the charts misleading and it seems  the fees built in to each transaction are unpredictable % and often much higher or lower than the chart prices. Additionally by listing so many inaccessible tokens and coins, it makes scrolling for research exhaustive.  
I have submitted suggestions to ‘enhance user experience ’ such as more detailed user portfolio including cost, cost average, profits or loss etc. at one point it seemed they were listening by replying that my ideas were ‘forwarded ‘.  So with each update comes ‘enhancements for user experience’ but each update focused more on NFT sales etc with no change for users view of their own holdings. 
4 of 5 stars Hoping someday they add the aforementioned features and have transparent retail cost and more accurate charts."

But that does no good because their price reporting is inaccurate. I figured it was a bug and reached out to support. They did nothing but copy and paste responses, and when I tried to get them to elaborate on what I’m asking I was told to “consider the subject exhausted.” Meaning they had no interest in telling me what I was trying to find out. They will show and record incorrect or higher than market prices, and those prices are shown when buying, but if you already own a coin, and go to sell at that same time, the selling price is magically way lower than any other price they’re showing. They’re graphs only load when they want, I couldn’t even try to tell you the refresh rate. I found out all of that AFTER trying to figure out how to move my money around in they’re system. You can buy with a card no problem for a fee, but when you go to sell or withdraw your funds you must make a separate wallet account, attach your bank account to it, and then start a withdrawal that takes a day. The entire App is made to take and keep your money. I applaud those who think positively of the app. I wish I could too."

When I wanted to withdraw it all back to my bank because it was way too complicated for me; I was told that my funds were frozen through a third party regulator.  I have spent over a week chatting with customer service.  I was originally told that I needed to pay BCT to get my account unfrozen.  I learned that this was a scam.  I have repeatedly chatted with “who is supposed to be customer service.”. I am being told I have to pay a deposit or bond of $104,000 to have my account unfrozen.  I have been told that if I don’t pay this amount after 5 days they will charge a 1% fee until my entire wallet is drained and they will be donating to charity.  I keep seeing there are scammers and I don’t need to pay to have my account unfrozen, but it is the same response from customer service.  
I have asked for a phone number, a manager, for it to be escalated and I receive nothing in return.  I do not want to pay a deposit or bond to receive my funds but I can’t seem to find any other options.

The issue is that the app is almost unusable. If anyone says this app is easy, they were lucky or lying. Banks consider it a scam, so just getting past that is a pain, but even if you do the app has an extreme chance of just glitching. Then if you do manage to begin trading there can be serious delays of over a week making it difficult to make time sensitive decisions. Lastly is what i consider to be mild scamming regarding transfers. Transferring into the app was very easy... Transferring out after being disappointed was obviously set up to be difficult. Setting up transfers is extremely glitchy and made me have to write down addresses manually because the app would glitch every time i went to copy one. Also with minimum limits far higher than the ones set for transferring in, i literally couldn't take out what i put in. Lastly the app is just simply slower and clunkier than any other crypto app ive found. 
I would consider this a work in progress except they have spent so much time and resources over the past year on marketing instead of development, so my hopes were completely gone."

As soon as it occurred to me that what had taken place was a scam, I emailed the app security and it was immediately locked down. I was so relieved in that moment. And then my nightmare began. I had to do video proof sessions that took place for hours at a time because they kept switching agents in the middle of the process on more than 3 different occasions because they have continuously locked me out of my account for no reason. Now I have changed my phone number several times as well (the same one each time) and I still need to change the number again which is beyond annoying because it takes hours and they never follow-through. So while I can vouch for the fact that it is a fun and exciting way to do crypto if you can sign in,  I cannot gaurantee you will always have that option. They have the worst customer service ever.

Small time funds will always be locked unlike many other exchanges with much lower, usually 0.001, or with Gemini, 0. If you’re using this to invest small time money of DCA I highly recommend turning away. This app has a $20 withdraw fee at .0004btc to move it to any more secure wallets. Their 2fa bugged out and I had to reset it. I had to spend over 4 days sending and buying funds to get enough btc to finally withdraw just to discover there’s a $20 withdraw fee. Every other exchange I can think of has fees so small they’re still under $10 when moving thousands. Half of this bad experience is due to my negligence of not researching withdraw mins and fees. So it goes to show to do your research. Either way it would not have ch aged my opinion, My mistake doesn’t negate that this app still has high withdrawal mins, high fees, and high withdraw fees.

This app is a joke, if you take any thing away from this, I used this for years transferred everything to Robinhood and Coinbase and will never come back. The other apps trade at market value with no commission, and only charge $5 month. That’s way better than paying a 5% premium on each coin/ stock.

I have yet to receive my card, but that’s because I live in the US and they just started shipping. If you want to take advantage of every aspect of crypto, this app is all around for you. It’s a multi purpose crypto wallet with the feel of a large bank! One thing I do think they need is a desktop platform.. so far they’re in the number one spot for the market they target, but imo a desktop version would give them a significant advantage over their competitors. As far seeing the bad reviews on here... working in business myself, reading the negative reviews then using the app.. I can say in full confidence that the negative reviews are due to user error lol regardless, give this app a chance! It won’t disappoint. Oh an No I’m not affiliated with them lol I just really like it"
crypto.com,ios,F. D. MLGK,2,2022-06-09 21:44:53,"But the fees are exaggerated, the limits to withdraw and deposit are insane especially for beginners and the worst - the amount of time they process withdrawals to another wallet takes forever. If a bitcoin can take awhile to process normally imagine with this platform, it’ll take maybe 10 times longer, its definitely not instant so if you pay someone using this platform expect to wait for confirmations or just pay whoever you are paying with cash - it might be easier or use other wallet like “ALL the other ones” so you don't have to wait for THEIR confirmations. I went to get a haircut expecting to get in and out and i ended up waiting another hour after my haircut because my payment wont transfer instantly. Time is Gold! And not to mention they use lingos that are so confusing in their App. I don’t know why i kept using this platform after close to 3 years of having this all the way back in the day when MCO was cool. Maybe because i try to give the benefit of a doubt for products i am loyal to regardless of the services, but sometimes loyalty becomes a chore and everything else falls apart."

The only time they answer is when I begin the support chat with “I want to close my account” they keep saying they need to confirm that my account is not under suspicious activity and that for me to close they have to enable my account I do all the steps they ask and nothing! Oh and they take forever to respond but if you take too much time to answer back they will close the chat and you’ll have to start the process again. The last thing I heard was “I’ll the revenant team to know that that have to enable your account” which was a week ago and they no longer answer. How many times do I have to confirm the logins?  how more selfie’s do I have to send ? How many more chats do I have to start?

This means they can block users from buying or selling at a time you can make or protect from loosing money.  
No app like that should have been allowed on Apple store.  This is criminal fraud!  Intent to commit fraud is a crime and using it to do so a crime.
Who is responsible to bring justice?  Yeah no one! So whatever money you put in here be prepared to login and see it disappear but not actually transact as a built in option they control.
The bug users reported they say was fixed. Well they now allow access and show totals that are accurate but individually block use for transactions. That’s fraud at its best.  If you now closed my account then give me my wallet I’d?  You had no problem taking my money.  It takes weeks of them telling me it’s my phone now they say senior management close my account?  Hello - Um where my money?  How many weeks till I can transfer my assets or cash out?  What a joke!

Eventually I staked CRO. First none of Credit cards in US works atleast what I hold. And then so much delay in transferring money to Fiat balance (4 or 5 days) by the time you end up investing thro other exchanges.  Even if u transfer most of time it’s slow and especially when big market movements and u wanted to use ur debit card to make faster purchase. Now it’s not even showing debit card option.

I wanted to highlight the notifications issue that's annoying so much. For the cryptos you track when you receive notifications abt price changes it's totally incorrect for the time. Price u see in notification and what you see after you tap to open are totally different. Not just by a fraction but by so many percentages. For example I see notification for  $1.82 up by 10% but upon opening it shows $1.55 down %. I end up disabling the notifications for now"

After calling the hotel I was able to see that there was no hold on the deposit and was advices to speak with crypto. Let me tell you this process was exhausting and untimely. The first representative stated that the money was returned, but I was able to submit a photo of the transaction still saying pending in my account. A day later, when I was finally able to text someone higher, they stated they needed proof and the money was returned again. After submitting proof that I had no extra charges from the hotel and left with a $0 balance, and the charge still shows as pending in my account my issue was still not resolved. I was told funds could return after 30-60 days but it’s up to the hotel to release the funds. This was frustrating to me considering the fact that I had already submitted evidence of the hotel not holding any funds. The help desk service for this card is ridiculous and most importantly the money that I worked for is apparently gone without a resolution. To be honest this entire deal seems like a scam."
crypto.com,ios,theOtherWB,4,2021-09-03 02:49:48,I’m only giving four stars because you really need to do your homework to learn about prices. The coins themselves have different sale % that come off the top. Crypto itself has no fees for buying/a unless you’re using your debit/ccard. However you need to learn the sale percentages of the coins. The price reflected on the graph daily is not the actual price. That’s the buy price. What I do is use the Binance app for the real price so that I’m not ticked off when I sell and find it’s $20 to sell when actually they’re reasonable. Setting up a bank account requires specific banks. Make sure yours is on the list. Once you get the hang of the fiat wallet and your buy/sale percentages it really is a great up. Set all your financial stuff up and get your bank account squared away before you buy anything. Get secure with how to get your money back into your pocket. Easy to use. Highly recommended.

Such as: I want to send a few dollars of bitcoin directly from the in-app wallet to another wallet. It glitches on my phone and shows me a blank screen. I have to use a friends phone. Multi factor authorization every time I log in. Turns out there’s a minimum to send bitcoin. Have to login to my phone again to buy more bitcoin. Log in to friends phone again. That’s four times I’ve had to use multi factor authorization now. Send Bitcoin. Oh there’s a fee and it’s 50% of the total amount sent? Fine. Oh and now I find out it will take 2-3 hours to process?

Absolutely miserable experience. I’m sure this app is great if you’re bored and have nothing else to do. If you’re busy and have a regular job and life, it’s a soul-sucking experience.

First you send a message to a robot then it say’s sorry we can’t help you we will send you to a live person. The person I got was pretty quick getting back but couldn’t fix my request so she had to send me to someone else. This was a joke. They sent me the same info the last person tried even though I had screenshots then I waited and waited for this last person to even see my message. I stared at my phone for 30 mins until I got tired of waiting. A hour or so later they sent me a message finally and all it said was looks like you are unavailable if you need anything else please feel free to send a message. Like what?? You only waited 21 mins before you said later. I waited a hour. All together it was a total of 3 hours to end up getting no help. I’m so angry right now. Glad it wasn’t an emergency!!!

After NUMEROUS “messaging conversations,” I’ve been left feeling completely helpless after receiving computer generated responses and not once being offered addl help in resolving the issue - or the $25 I was promised for signing up. 
After trying multiple different types of payment methods from debit to credit cards and being unsuccessful at every turn, I don’t have so much as a customer service number to call and speak to anyone about this. I’ve spoken to my banks multiple times and after asking several times for a customer service number during these message conversations, I have yet to receive a number or response regarding my question. It’s been a 3-day process and I have yet to be able to invest a single dollar because of this flawed system. 
If you’re looking to invest in the “near-future” and don’t mind being left helplessly in the dark, this may be the place for you, if not, and you’re looking to hop the train sooner than later, I'd look elsewhere."

I have had a chat open for over 48hrs with tech support and have not had one response yet. Therefore, I have no access to my crypto for the past 4 days. I tried all the options and even followed step by step instructions on the FAQ page. Nothing has worked. Deleted the app, reinstalled it, emptied my cache in my browser and deleted all emails like it says to do. Still no access to my account. Be very careful where you keep your crypto.

Unfortunately many features on the app just did not work for me.. was unable to purchase with a Credit Card (tried several times with two cards.. I even tried on different days. I just got a blank empty screen.. I called my bank, but they had no record of the attempts) the app will frequently freeze up and I had to attempt my first few purchases multiple times because the price would update.. this is fine, except it would kick me all the way back to the Home Screen and make me start over.

Then, it turns out they “can’t verify” me... not sure why. No option to check pictures or answer questions or anything, so I reached out to customer service again. Same thing, no response until several hours later in the middle of the night, only to tell me THEY DONT HAVE TO TELL why they reject people, and then closed the chat because I wasn’t responsive.  Super disrespectful to treat people like that who have trusted them with their sensitive info. At least have the courtesy to explain what’s going on or give an opportunity to work through whatever the mystery issue is. All my accounts are in good standing.

They said they cannot help me unless I were to put more money in, wait for it to transfer and then withdraw it out once I reach the threshold. I do not need to be working on my masters in cyber security to comprehend how a legitimate business would ever tell a customer to just give them deposit money to receive money back. Please be extremely careful and do your research before making investments when using shady and up and coming applications. I am writing a report for my class about fraudulent online storefronts and I am referencing this app in particular. The customer service was very vague when asking particular questions about security concerns. I am hesitant to call it a scam outright but I do not feel comfortable depositing more money into the app to revive my current balance. That should speak volumes to new customers.

App has been occasionally glitchy over the past few years, including quite recently, and kept me from selling when time was of the essence. (Often this is because an update is available, but it won’t tell you this, it just glitches on sales!) Was wary but could have handled that if they weren’t getting overtly propagandistic. 

We all know you made a deal with the devil by pouring insane amounts of influence money into the election but leave your customers out of it. Final straw after more and more annoying push notifications trying to encourage market volatility and forcibly shoving customers into the incredibly high risk Strike Options screen.

The UI is extremely difficult to understand since they use odd terminology that would normally mean other things like “transfer” might mean to another wallet and not from one coin to another or you might need to select the word “sell” when you just want to convert one coin to another.  It gets really confusing and is not user friendly at all.  Support is very, very poor.  I ordered the debit card and got an email saying it had been sent but it didn’t come.  After a couple weeks I wrote to support but they never answered.  I finally got the card two weeks later and activated it.  I tried to top it off with the balance the app said I had but my balance was in their coin and it doesn’t have an option to use that for the card.  I tried to sell their coin but it said it was locked.  It turns out, the balance was from their “gift” which can’t be unlocked unless I buy more coins and stake them.  It was complete deceit.

They have no morals and should you choose to ignore my warning, be prepared to never see any $ they control ever again. This is the single most dishonest company ive ever encountered and urge you NOT to download this app. Hope this app gets pulled from the App Store bc its basically designed to never let users access actual money.

So, even if you make tons of money off crypto...they’ll never let you actually get your hands on it! You wouldn’t believe the excuses I’ve been given.

But low and behold, I cannot actually complete the transfer because the app freezes as soon as I click “confirm” to transfer my money out. Then I contact customer service again and they are asking for more ridiculous things. I don’t understand how I have to keep contacting customer service to trade my stocks and transfer my money. 

This app is a scam! Do not use it to trade crypto. All they do is take your money hostage and make you jump through hoops for the most basic features. Now I want to close my account and it’s one headache after another."

Although nothing is without its faults, I do have a bit of a problem with the notification system. I have multiple types of notifications set to go off if some cryptos hit different price point but they never go off. Even with notifications on in-app and in the settings on my phone.
I’ve missed out on some big opportunities because of this. I don’t want to have to move to another app to fix this issue so it’d be awesome if you couple help resolve it.

 P.S. It’d be awesome if you were to tweak the little colorful screen and sound it does when you successfully buy or trade by adding a little vibration. That would be a really nice touch, kinda like a cherry on top this already really cool app!"

Also I could use the support chat with was instant until I needed a tech specialist now over gone 48 hours without and answer other than “thanks for your comment and if you have any more questions were just a message away”.

Also when buying or selling you have to buy a minimum and when selling there is a minimum which then if you don’t have enough to sell what are you suppose to do? 
You also have to have a minimum to move off the exchange so the only option ends up buying more coins to sell or move! Such a scam. 
And lastly, when buying I notice the prices are higher than other exchanges and lower when selling! This company is ripping all of us off. Very annoyed and bought when I was newer into crypto and didn’t know better. Now I will definitely lose huge profits due to their company policies. 
Do not use until they change their fees! It’s definitely not easy to know this up front! Hope this helps others."

I tried two more times and still didn’t work. Two days later, I saw 3 withdrawals on my checking. So the payments went through without telling me they did, and was super slow because the bitcoin went up afterward and thus forced me to buy it at a higher price than what I originally was paying for. 
So I try to withdraw my money out of the Bitcoin ownership and there is no clear way of doing that! All they allowed me to do was to transfer it to another coin or purse.

I just spent FOUR YEARS fighting a $20,000 tax bill for a year when I only made $1,000 through investments - do those numbers add up? NOPE. Third - Strike Options are clearly rigged. There is a demo simulator for you to play around with and test strategies. Sounds neat, problem is the simulator will let you win most trades at a higher rate than the real system. So in the simulator you’ll make bank but then when you apply the exact same strategy to live trading it just takes all your money. This is clearly designed to manipulate investors by instilling false-confidence. These people are scammers, liars, cheaters, and thieves all the way through.

It’s nice getting 3% CRO on purchases, but as of last week the CRO price dropped to about half of 5-6 weeks ago. Last thoughts, they have made every decision (the kind that hit ur financial enterprise) with zero notice, literally with zero second notice. And, there have been a few back to back. So, if you want to earn 3% (CRO) on purchases, and don’t trade more than $25K in trades a month; it’s not bad, even okay."
crypto.com,ios,VictorMac62,5,2019-09-16 14:22:13,Crypto adaption is here!! One stop shop. There support here is spot on.  If I have questions or issue they get back quick and resolve issues quick!!  I started out with the basic card by accident and upgraded to the jade card with help from support. Then I got my card Friday and went to activate it on Saturday morning the activation button was not there I contacted support and I gave them a screenshot and they said they would have there team take care of it and it might take 2 maybe 3 days because it was the weekend. I checked it late that after noon and it was fixed and now my card is up and running!! So impressed!! Coinbase Who??  Your at the right place at the right time here. I don’t usually give reviews but I’m highly impressed with the professionalism they have here!! They are the winning team!! Thanks you for your awesome support!!
crypto.com,ios,Jones G-Money,1,2020-12-30 11:11:57,"The spread is ridiculously wide; you’d end up losing 6 to 12 times the amount you would have paid for an average commission with other brokers per trade.  It doesn’t have Exchange, so you’re pretty much playing roulettes and hope your gains don’t end up getting spent on the spread when trading.  If the value of your coins drop in the middle of the night or when you’re away from your phone, good luck managing your losses.  The only possible way it could be useful is when you’re holding your coins long term, but then you’ll have to worry losing money on conversion and then fees transferring them out. I bet they make a ton of money with how wide the spread is and the difference in conversion. When you’re buying and selling, there are options to convert it to either CRO, USDM, or BTC.  I find the USDM to have smaller conversion difference but good luck with being consistent with choosing it. Those three options get shuffled all the time as if it is designed with the purpose of making you make mistake in choosing their own coin CRO.  The whole thing is sketchy."

The customer service is outstanding! I’ve only had one issue with this app/company since I’ve started using it in March 2021. The issue was actually in their DeFi wallet app. The customer service rep I worked with in the chat had my problem resolved same day. They walked me through every step and were just amazing. They are always quick to respond too. 

I always recommend this app to everyone who asks me what apps to use or to people on social media asking which app to use. It’s just so easy to use and they have a wide variety of crypto coins to invest in. If you are considering this app, download it! You will be happy that you did."

**So months later I , very much am in awe that it’s not only still bad, but in fact gotten even worse. 
Withdrawals are “pending” for HOURS now. Deposits ONLY show up, after you panic, contact ‘support’ WAIT FOREVER TO HEAR BACK, then ur money shows up, and support tries to make you feel dumb like, “I see your deposit is in your account” 
No kidsing? Just like the last 10 times, it’s in my account SUDDENLY, after I tell you I noticed it wasn’t in my account. 
THAT IS MORE THAN ENOUGH TO SCARE ME  OFF. What a shame. This app was promising for quite awhile. It’s the next FTX you’ve been warned!!!!**

This app was 5 starts easy, until the last 5-6 months. Lately I have had a problem with 75% of all my transactions. Although I was able to receive my crypto deposits eventually, it’s been very frustrating having to hit up support every time I deposit, because my transactions don’t show up otherwise! I’ll see them on the blockchain, confirmed, and not in my wallet. Now it’s also with withdrawal- hopefully this is a fluke thing- but I have had 2 withdrawals in last 2 days both not even initiated after 2 whole hours! That’s not the expectations I have from an app named CRYPTO DOT COM. I would recommend this app over most other wallets until now. I’m pretty much making my way back to another app rhymes with join face. It’s alright. If y’all can’t fix these ongoing issues, why would i continue to use your services??"
crypto.com,ios,AgentAbsurdia,1,2021-04-25 10:23:20,"Do not trust this app. Of all the trading methods I’ve come across this one is by far the worst. Limit amount of currencies that you can actually trade. The layout is confusing, and people seem to only be recommending it based on incentives. 

The market data is also not reliable by a long shot. The graphs never match the actual current prices, and is limited to only an 8 hour snap shot. No zooming in, or getting real time stats. They lure you in with free trades for a month, but after that there’s no way it’s worth paying this company to trade as they offer nothing credible to justify it. Their debit card options are based on their poorly earning in-house crypto that doesn’t hold much value at all. The kicker is that you have to stake a set amount of money to keep any rewards you would benefit from staking. Specially when you end up likely going broke keeping your money with them. 

If your looking for trading crypto look elsewhere. Even the limited options with Robin Hood and Webull still give far more in-depth stats with free trades. Be warned."
crypto.com,ios,CxPTxN,4,2021-11-04 17:14:01,I love this app - new coins all the time and makes it much easier to buy and sell crypto without having to go through swaps. Couple great features they need to add is what your gains/losses is on a crypto. Basically you have to add up what you invested and then subtract that from the value of your investment to see what you’ve gained… not hard to do but other apps have easily showed your gains without having to do all that. Second would be a showing you your positions when you click on the coins from the Home Screen. Right now you have to goto your wallet to see where you’re at instead of just clicking the coin from the Load up page. Which you then need to add up yourself as stated above. Other than that it’s an amazing app that will make some people very very rich! Fortune Favors The Brave!

I believe in the CRO staking, don’t get me wrong.  However you WILL be overpaying in price and there will be fees for every transaction if you’re using credit.

ACH and wiring funds, you say? Well call it “instant Deposit and they can use the money to buy our crypto!” Except 2 and a half weeks run by and they threaten to liquidate positions because the money hasn’t come through yet. 

Segway to customer support! They have a support team? You could’ve fooled me. God forbid you have to deal with this during your time on the platform. The days-spaced corporate verbal diarrhea is pathetic. I asked about my ACH deposit for a third time, at which I had three days to finalize it according to an email that was sent after the exchange of messages. But guess what? My bank doesn’t have what they need to verify! Run past the deadline and here we are again. Another ACH fund that’s been processing for 2 weeks now and I am inable to send my crypto anywhere else."

I put money on this app from my bank and traded with crypto so it could have gains. As soon the I noticed the market rise and tried to withdrew my gains this app never allowed me to. They requested for a document and after providing it they request for an alternative document and keep requesting. Worst part is their contact support always tells you there is nothing they can do and they ca not share information with you so you have both the account and your money including the gains all gone. They will not allow you to resolve a dispute but always looking for ways to block your account and take your money referring you to their terms and condition that says they can go away with your money if you have issues with your account. This app is shady. Very shady!!! Please take this app down because they are very unprofessional at dealing with dispute and always want to close your money with the account.

Love the card, love the staking benefits, and crypto purchase without fees, but I would really appreciate a greater amount of CRO trading pairs and more advanced market orders. I feel like its one of the areas in which your app lags. I think level 2 market data should also be a consideration but primarily behind more advanced trading orders, the app really needs a refresher visually and with more chart options. I cant really trade when Im just looking at a line without a distinct time frame. You need candles and multipe time frames. take a page from webull or tradingviews book. When you dont give the customer complete control of the price and an inaccurate view of the price action, your zero fees dont matter because you more than likely profit off the difference of market orders and customer orders."

The majority of the customer support interactions I have had have also been quite poor, with agents often having contradictory information, with one agent being outright disrespectful AND incorrect about the platform they represent. 

I have been left in the dark and “reassured” that my “case had been brought up internally” despite this, they are unable to give me any reason at all as to why my account cannot be approved despite many others platforms verifying my information in minutes, not months, with less documentation provided as well. Not only this, but customer service will close your conversation while you are still waiting to be approved, forcing you to reach back out, be transferred to a specialist with no warning, only for them to reassure you while you wait months to access your funds.

If you for some reason decide to use this platform over another, you must realize you will be forced to transfer your funds to another platform if you would like to cash out, meaning you will be faced with additional fees that could have been avoided. My experience is far from original, and I would recommend everything against this platform, they are not here to help."

This is no insult to Indian people whatsoever I am brown as well however it is very well known that India is the epicenter for Internet scams and credit card fraud companies.

Before that I had to maneuver my phone x different ways just to capture my license! Pushing on, when doing everything manually, once it came time to take my picture and submitting it, the app crashed the second I tapped continue. EVERY TIME!
‘Deep breath’ it eventually worked after deleting and reloading the app. 

However now there’s a different issue. After the first 100 hurdles, I was told my account needed to be verified and etc and I’d be notified in 2-3 days. Cool whatever. My friend said it took her maybe a few minutes to hours so I decided to try my luck. Now this might just be the app trying to wait till I get approved but if I try to log on with my e-mail, I wants to do the little puzzle slide thing “verify you’re not a robot” thing then sends me a confirmation e-mail. I open it and click on it, takes me back to the app. Green screen with a “e-mail confirmed. Hit anywhere to continue” tap the screen and back to the “sign up/log on” page. Like what?! 🤯. This happens every time. Like I said, maybe it’s because my account didn’t verified yet, idk.

When signing up, I was asked for my nationality. I entered it and followed their requested steps. The next day, it asked me to resubmit my documents, so I did. After again being asked to resubmit, I reached out to support who told me to check my spam folder. Yep, there’s the rejection, saying that I should ignore my nationality and instead use my country of residence. That’s annoying and two days wasted...

So, I submit different docs and get confirmation within a few minutes. Awesome! I generate a BTC deposit address and send over a small amount for testing. Ten minutes later, I get a notification of the pending deposit, saying the amount will be available once there are two confirmations - pretty standard. Well, there are now four confirmations and my deposit is still pending. For reference, a transaction I sent after this on CoinSwap has already been deposited, which means two separate series of confirmations have completed.

While some of their features are promising, their UI is misleading and backend functionality isn’t working as advertised. Hopefully I’ll be able to update this review with better news soon.

Update: it’s now been over an hour and a half with eight confirmations - and my transaction is still pending.

Update 2: deposit became available between ten and 12 confirmations. That’s pretty bad. We’ll see if I try again later..."

There is mo way the app is designed by someone striving for ergonomics and efficiency. The only reason the app is still downloaded on my phone is because of how hard they make it to withdraw money. You cannot withdraw money to your bank account in the same manner you put it in like EVERY OTHER APP. They make it easy to invest with a debit card then a 10 step process to withdraw any earnings and even then if your bank isn’t recognized my PLAID you can’t even manually put in the account and routing numbers. Do not put any money in this app if you ever expect to get it back.

I DO NOT want to invest in any more crypto as I am strapped for cash right now, and It is too risky for me to do right now.

I was NOT warned when buying small amounts of crypto that I wouldn’t be able to withdraw it. I contacted customer service about it, and they said theres nothing I can do unless I buy more bitcoin first…which I don’t have the ability to do right now.

crypto.com,ios,Bilbogetthisbaggins,5,2021-05-16 02:29:35,Slowest customer service ever. A week with no response. So if you like to buy or trade often this app is trash. Debit cards and credit cards get declined by cro all the time. Had them charge me for 4 declined transactions. My bank said my card wasn’t blocked by them and that’s why all the charges went through. Took a week to get the coins. Even though they took the money and declined me. Ended up buying 4 times as much as I planned cause they charged me even though it didn’t go through. The reason this is important is when you want to buy during a dip and they keep declining cards and Are unable to be reached ever. You may miss a good time to buy. So sad was very excited to try this app. Will be switching all crypto to another program.

I put in more than several hundred dollars of CRO to lockup (this is not the problem) so I can access a card. The problem is that even though my cro is locked up I still can’t get a card due to the app being too broken to input my SSN and address. I tried speaking with support, they kept saying “kindly, try again” an actual person told me that several times and each time it still failed, the only way I can even input the ssn is by attempting to open the fiat wallet because the crypto card page has the button but that button doesn’t do anything. I tried showing my ID with address to the support specialist and that also made no difference, I did get an email saying it failed so I think they tried the same thing I’m trying.

While it’s nice to have a place to purchase and store crypto that is easily accessible and user friendly for the most part, there is not much that separates this company from its competition, in my opinion.

With few positives, and so many negatives, this app hs certainly lost my business.

They bully users into agreeing with terms and conditions that are entirely unfavorable and unfair to the customer. They appear to offer very favorable terms on their credit cards, but then reveal that those terms are only for those staking large amounts of money. They wanted to charge me a $50 upgrade fee just for upgrading my card, though I never even had a physical card. The false advertising, privacy breaches, and more place this poor company far down on my list.

There is no explanation to the issue, and no solution to the problem. Also, the customer service is awful. They only told me that there was no restriction on the account and they refused to investigate the issue. I tried later and to my surprise, small transfers can be completed. I think they are manipulating the system to impede customers from completing big transfers and force us to make small transfers so we end up paying more in fees. If I’m correct, that’s a shady procedure and they are thieves. I have reported them to the FTC, the FBI and other federal agencies. Thanks god they are regulated by the federal government.

It only gives you 2% back after you put in $1000s of dollars. Better off getting a citi card. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS. They collect your very highly sensitive data and hold their free debt card hostage. There is no debt card. It should not take 3 months to ship a debt card. And the come back to say, we need to verify your address. Send us all your personal details. But before then they were stating that they haven’t shipped it due to Covid or a printing issue. You will see their BOT comment below stating to contact customer service.

Every bank I speak to or card issuer informs me that there is no authorization attempt from the app. 

I don’t know how you’re supposed to run a successful business when people can’t even make purchases.

Why do these cryptos currency apps all have false advertisement ? Not the only app that this has happened to me. Then real problem is the customer service, hard to locate on app, and not much service. All I wanted was to cancel account, no app function that does that. After answering dozens of questions that don’t apply in a bizarre bot maze flow chart, I had Jadon on message. He told me to get a paper towel and write I would like to cancel my account and hold up to face and take a selfie and send pic to him. Never heard of such silliness, I didn’t do it. Anyways, don’t get this app, they screwed up lying and then bad customer service."
crypto.com,ios,idgaf🖤,1,2024-11-27 09:45:12,"Please do not download this app or deposit any money within this app. The customer service agents will purposely create an email that looks similar to yours maybe add a couple letters after it or before it or a couple numbers within it to basically impose as you and then will tell you to verify to make sure it’s your email and then pretend like they’re sending you verification links to verify your email, and then you will still be locked out of your account and unable to move your funds back to your bank account. Be careful because that’s what I’m dealing with currently. I was almost scammed into sending my funds off in an illegal cryptocurrency trade, but before that happened, I was able to figure out the scam and I’m trying to move the money back into my bank account as I’ve already made a deposit. The customer service are unhelpful and illogical. Please do not work with them. Stay away from this app!!!!"
crypto.com,ios,DarcyIsabel,1,2021-09-20 23:19:02,"Testing out the crypto market and it has limits in place that are difficult when you’re trying something new. I only signed up because a friend of sent me a referral link where we would both get free crypto if someone who’s referred would sign up, but we wouldn’t get it unless we spent a minimum already on that same crypto. Then I tried purchasing some and chose to not keep it due to dramatically falling prices and it took me forever and several time reaching out to customer support to figure out how to sell and get my little bit of money back. After selling, I tried to transfer to my bank account and was notified I had to have a minimum of a $100 transfer but of course since the crypto value had fallen so drastically, I didn’t have that and am now just out of that money fully as it sits in the app. Not user friendly at all, but I will say customer support is kind and friendly and always willing to help"

I thought it would be awesome… However it’s basically a scam. Once downloading the app, i obviously wanted to buy crypto … so i added money to the card… but the card they give CANT BUY CRYPTO lol what a joke … So once i realize the card is pointless, i decide if I’m gonna have it i might as well upgrade to get the rewards… so i upgraded based on the ad on my app… The moment i clicked upgrade, my entire balance disappeared…. I have been trying to get my money back sense…. They keep saying they have to transfer the balance …. Like from THEIR old card yo THEIR new card. I’m 8 days into this process, bills are due lol and they are holding my money hostage… Lastly i can go put money and the new card the moment it was issued … but for some reason they can’t return my balance for 8 days!? Nor do you get any real answer about when you will get it"
crypto.com,ios,eyewrench,1,2021-11-07 13:59:46,"I would not recommend this app for someone wanting to purchase crypto, as it’s lacking some of the most basic features an investor in crypto would want. For instance, your cost basis is not displayed - if you want to find out your average cost for a position, you have to crank out the math and add up all your individual transactions the painstaking way. The app also doesn’t display your overall percentage up or down, or dollar value up or down, on a position. Additionally, there’s a glitch with the SHIB display where it’s not showing the original transaction conversion in dollars. The items mentioned above are some of the most essential, expected pieces of data one finds on all other brokerage apps, but one doesn’t find it here, even though it would be so easy for the developers to add - for some odd reason they just haven’t done it. I don’t know if it’s laziness or obstinance or what. Very disappointing, I think I’ll look elsewhere."

They lost my account attached to my email and now stating the issue is on my end. They have been working on this issue for 2+weeks stating they will contact me when resolved but after 2-3 days of no update I message back to follow up and they start the entire verification process over again with selfie and other info only to not come up with an answer and delay by stating they are still working on issue. This happens repeatedly each day I contact them this process starts from the beginning. I would never use this app or company to trade or buy crypto with!
crypto.com,ios,Oops 13,3,2025-01-01 23:28:05,Not as easy as you’d expect. You won’t be able to buy right away. Transferring money gets blocked by banks. Ach didn’t work. Credit card didn’t work. Debit card didn’t work. Direct transfer once set up worked. However if you purchase crypto and have a remainder it doesn’t let you transfer more funds right away if at all to buy anything else. States not enough funds where you’d deposit from your bank account otherwise it wants to liquidate your crypto for the sale. Alerts for prices can’t notify your phone. You need to monitor your email 24/7. Might as well watch the screen. It’s also loaded with senseless badges and distractions. The favorite button doesn’t display what you favorited but a majority favorites list. Kind of a weird app for the popularity of 5 star reviews.

Little did I know the company doesn’t have a phone service. They only have the stupid bot service. that loops you in an endless conversation about nothing. once I realized this, I tried to close my account little did I know there’s no way to do it on the app. so I had to contact customer service unfortunately. it has now been two days since I decided to close this hellhole of an account. And have yet to have the problem resolved. I actually did have someone contact me back on the app only to tell me that I would be  contacted via email. which was really annoying because they could have used that time to actually solve my problem instead of telling me that. I honestly believe the customer service team for this company is a joke."
crypto.com,ios,PloppyJoe89,4,2021-12-03 05:59:53,"Hopped on the app after a few friends recommended it and was initially intrigued. Invested in a variety of crypto but then for a 3 day stint the app would glitch every time I would buy and only go through intermittently, requiring me to redo transactions dozens of times. There is also no quick and easy interface to track initial investment and ROI at a quick glance. The daily swing percentages are cool but we all care more about our wallet health and being able to quickly ascertain it! 

I agree with other users that the UI needs a definite upgrade (see above). Overall though has a lot of potential and I like the wide breadth of coins available. True rating 3.5 stars. Fix a few things and 4 star and beyond app for sure"
crypto.com,ios,srsimpson727,3,2021-03-09 01:00:25,"This app is definitely not the worst. They offer a prepaid metal Visa card that you can load with your crypto wallet which is pretty awesome. It’s one of my favorite features, but my big hang-up is that I was losing significant amounts of money on trades and couldn’t figure out why. I finally realized that their graphs follow closely with crypto prices but aren’t exact - usually they’re above the actual prices. So when you sell, you tend to receive a lower amount & when you buy, you pay their advertised higher amount. I’ve time stamped some screenshots of this issue for reference where there was an advertised difference of $250 on Bitcoin prices. As a user if you’re going to invest long-term, this is a great app, but if you plan to day trade you may lose money. That being said, I still plan to use this app. The good definitely outweighs the bad if you know what you’re doing."

At one point I withdrew all my money from this trading service. Recently months later I saw a transaction made on my account which I did not make! Which means security is a major issue. When I emailed them to delete my account they told me they would not delete my account without me taking a selfie photo holding a sign that read my name the date and close delete account which I did not want to provide as I don’t know what they would do with a picture of me or why they would need this. They didn’t need this to open the account this is a corrupt business with shady practices if this is where you want to invest your money good luck! Why they would need a selfie of me for for authentication is beyond me and absolutely ridiculous in 2021! Mind you there is 0 dollar balance.

And o boy, i never experienced something like that,
First it takes 2 day for some to answer your, this person texted me at 11:30pm, I was a sleep and she terminated the conversation i text back and again waiting to se if one day y can get my money out

Also I transferred an “instant transfer” and almost two weeks now and my funds are not available yet but I can lose them to bitcoin (wth is up with that) I wish I could give 0 stars.

What they don’t tell you, is that you don’t get that $25, until they have invested $4000 into crypto coin and reserved their metal card. Which, requires you too invest the $4000. It’s a dirt bag move, because you don’t know this, until you have signed up completely. The app is fine, but that’s just a dirty business move and makes the company seem untrustworthy. Get rid of the bonus in all, or just make it $5 for signing up. How does, giving people a card and $25. Equal to us putting $4000 into a crypto that is not even that popular? I’m not saying people entitled to anything, but just get rid of in all. If someone is going to invest that much money in your coin, I highly doubt they give a crap about $25 or a metal card."

Plus when I bought it, it was at 15 and then when I owned it, I somehow bought it at 20 even though it never made it to 20 during the day I bought it? Coinbase was a dream compared to this rapist app. None of these ‘surprises’ happened there, these are just in your face bend over muggers. They caught the wave of people rushing into this blindly hoping they didn’t miss their chance. I only went here because they had some currencies that coinbase didn’t. They know what they’re doing. And in the end they have to own up to it. I like their free money offer - but only if you get their credit card, and the money comes in their own currency. Gross."

 When attempting to login, an error message comes up saying to contact support. Took over 5 weeks and over 20 emails for me to finally get a response as to why I could not log into my account. Emails initially took 3-5 days to get responses and I included every reply in the email string thinking, I would not have to repeat the same information. 

 The first 8 emails I was asked if I was still having the issue since it’s been a few days since they responded. They asked me to respond if I still was having the issue. I would say yes. After 3-5 days again, they would ask if I was still having the issues since it’s been a few days again. It was an endless loop of ridiculousness. 

 Later they transitioned to asking me for information to verify account ownership. It was provided in 8 emails just be asked the same question again, please provide the following information to verify your account ownership. In the last couple of emails they then said information needed to be uploaded to verify account. Again, my issue was that I could not log into my account.

API integrated software doesn’t allow this so you so your money will be stuck in their app until they fix this. They tell you banks on the list do withdrawals but all the banks got smart and start blocking third party Authentication logins so the list of banks all fail to authenticate. Then when you reach out to chat the repeat/copy and paste the same message over and over again instead just telling you, you’re fcuked! They won’t even tell you what banks won’t block you so good luck giving them your money and never getting to see it again.

What I have in there will sit until I move to cold storage.  Basically, this app went from something I ran thousands of dollars a week through, using it basically every where I go, to a HODL account that will never get another deposit from me.  I feel like I am about to lose a ton of money.  I hope I am wrong.  But, my fiat Bank of America card now has better rewards that this card.  That is pathetic.  I wouldn’t recommend getting involved in this company.  They have already been bought out.  Really disappointed."

But, as you use the app, you notice that the active price they show is ALWAYS inflated when compared to other apps or places across the internet, so you pay more. Then, as I buy BTC I transfer it to my hard wallet. This morning they charged me .0006 BTC or $39 to move .0028 BTC or $160 approx. That is about a 25% transfer fee. I went back and looked at other transactions here and they charged similar. I checked on withdrawal transactions from other exchanges that I have completed and this is way above and beyond what many are charging by a large margin. I feel robbed and will not be doing business with them any longer."

I noticed unauthorized charges happening on my bank account from Gibraltar (a place I’ve never visited) that were affiliated with this app. When I brought it to their attention, they banned my account and access. Fortunately, I notified my bank first.  Customer service is not on top of things at all. It takes too long to get a response and issues are not even resolved when they finally do respond. I only trusted this website because they seemed reputable from a cypto conference that my friend attended in the Bay Area. I liked the fact they offered the card but now it’s useless since I can’t access the funds I put on it. I’m thinking Nexo might be more reliable in that regard when their card is made available. I would never trust this website again. Unauthorized charges were made numerous times."

If you're looking to also invest 50 dollars with no fee only to see it really invested only 45 for some reason and never be told where the 5 went this is the perfect app for that! Money goes missing and your money becomes forever inaccessible by you and you get to watch some numbers on a screen forever knowing they'll always have your money and there is nothing you can do about it because youll just run into another rabbit hole of issues whenever you try and take out your earnings or get your randomly disappearing cash without explanation of where it is! I would highly recommend this app to anyone looking to invest and never see it again!
crypto.com,ios,Crypto.com review,1,2025-03-16 14:58:49,I loved this app for a lot of reasons the fees to get my money on here was a little high since I transferred it over but I truly like the app. Now I’ve withdrawn my money so I can buy a home. All my funds got to my bank however when I look for a transaction history the only thing the app offers is a very basic looking excel chart. A document I sent to the bank and they won’t accept it because it looks like a document I could’ve  made. This should be something very basic that any financial institution should provide to their clients specially when holding their money. How is it possible you guys don’t provide a monthly financial statement to have proof of their funds? Now I have a good chunk of cash that I can’t use towards my home. I have asked support and they have said this is the only documentation they can provide me. Very unfortunate situation
crypto.com,ios,j_vena,1,2025-02-11 01:04:32,"I say sleezy instead of scammy because these guys won’t outright steal your money. They will nickel and dime you with higher fees than most. They also overestimate coin values to drive hype. And they won’t let you close your account. 

I transferred out as much as I could, but they kept ~$1 worth of crypto in the account which they said I couldn’t transfer out. I tried closing the account, and they said I can’t close the account while there is still a balance. But because I am below the minimum withdrawal limit, they said I have to deposit more money in order to withdraw all the money and subsequently close my account. If I did that, by the way, they would make sure to take a fee from my withdrawal which would be greater than my current remaining balance. And I’m not convinced they would allow me to withdraw all of it since they caused this issue by not allowing me to withdraw all the money anyway."
crypto.com,ios,Patrickh1756,1,2021-05-24 20:25:57,"I’ve never gave a review, but this app is so bad that I had to. 
First off, it took a week to make an account because the app crashes every time I tried to confirm my email. 
Secondly, after I finally managed to create an account, it takes me forever to actually open the app. I have to close and reopen at least 5 times before the app finally opens, and sometimes it doesn’t even open then. It only shows me the opening logo. 
Lastly, a major problem (if you can get this far) is trying to fund your account. I’ve tried funding my account from 3 different bank accounts, but all of them report it as a security threat. Yes, you could say that it’s my bank’s fault or that I could spend another day trying to fix this, but surely the app developer could fix this problem if they want to be a professional crypto exchange. In my opinion, this app needs a lot of work."
crypto.com,ios,KickingCoach,1,2021-03-16 05:14:39,"I began experimenting with Crypto and opened an account with this app last week. I found an app that works better for me and have been trying to withdraw my money from this app and close my account. I was not made aware during signup that I would not be able to withdraw amounts less than $100. I do not have $100 in my account and do not intent to have $100 in my account. I have contacted customer service three times. Twice in the app and once through email and have not gotten a response. It’s my money so I should not be told I cannot withdraw my own money if I have less than $100 in my account.

Ps. Finally got a response and they still refuse to refund my money. I became very frustrated and used some choice words in one of my emails to them and their customer service person actually scolded me for talking like that. They’re literally more concerned with how I talk than they are with helping me out."

I have no idea what this company is doing if your trying to supply a service during a high interest event as crypto is I would think you would be prepared for amount of volume coming in the door. And sending a blank statement 2-3 days when I have colleagues around me getting approved left and right makes me question the make up of the organization and business your running terrible business.
crypto.com,ios,Zergination,2,2025-02-09 05:44:57,"The app is limited. They added stocks and sports betting instead of enhancing and building off of the crypto platform. There is no where to find fees charged, no information on bid vs ask price, no way to tie in a live portfolio tracking app, little information about airdrop for Cro returns (I put in $130 worth of Cro for a $0.13 return in a month. In that time the Cro dropped 10% or more). Their app made it look like I would get a 6% return instead of a .1% return. 

The presentation of where your assets are at is poor. If you have a sell order on a coin it won’t appear in your crypto portfolio. 

You can set up 2 factor authentication but not with a YubiKey or other security key. Also, there’s little response from customer service. In short there is so much room for a new competitor to grab US customers or for this app to grow. 

After posting my first review I got an email denying me from depositing more money into the app. I then got another email about changing my review or contacting the developer. The link to contact the developer only had a link to articles on the site but no place to contact the developer or customer service. The articles had nothing about setting up a security key with 2FA. Due to this I’m lowering my rating from a 3/5 to 2/5."

The response I got was “the graph is only an estimate and not the true value of the coin” I lost my $500. 

It doesn’t make sense for them to show me a graph of the value of the coin and then later tell me that the graph doesn’t actually mean anything. Total bull.

The nicest thing is that it is great not to use a traditional bank (all the fees and charges and no interest on savings to speak of).

They claim they didn’t but my statement and my bank both conclude it went to them. Would not recommend risking it with this company. They are very rude. It also took them 1-2 days to get back to me and tell me my bank is wrong. They just point fingers and do the “check with your bank, it’s not on us” even though it’s obvious that if the statement says where the money went and the bank confirms it went to them that it went to them.

So as of now I have shares in limbo on this app without any way to move it around. Still waiting on an email back, and multiple chat questions pending with a status of “not read”. Frustrating.

Found out this app is a scam. STAY AWAY. Let me say it again, STAY AWAY. You are subject to being locked out of your own account without any way to contact support. It is impossible to move your shares after this happens. The funny thing is you can watch you shares succeed with no way of interacting with it. Do yourself a favor and find an app that uses cold storage. I will gladly pay dumb fees as long as I know there is security behind it.

I noticed upon completion of my application that it hadn’t let me submit an address for shipping the card so I contacted their support center only to start a long uphill battle that would last me an entire day and still remain unresolved. I wanted to change my address for shipping but they had claimed it’s too late and because the address they have on file isn’t valid they’re not going to send the card regardless. I had asked for a refund of my money and they say they’re still going to hold it even though they can’t hold up their end of the bargain!

After being left on read countless times, my questions denied being answered, submitting countless documents and photos I still couldn’t get them to send me a card. They left me on read for hours trying to complete a simple task. When I would ask for a manager I would be ignored every time.

It’s just a horrible experience and it’s unsafe for individuals to use.

Don’t mess with this company or this application."
crypto.com,ios,BobbyRobby1310,1,2020-11-14 08:52:28,I downloaded this app after hearing about the card involved and being interested. The process to get the card is to make an investment of a certain amount into their currency. That’s fine and I did that but it’s the first step in the application. I stay in military barracks and we receive our mail at a UPS store where I have a mailbox. I have received a debit card here and this is where I receive mail. Customer service is absolutely not willing to send the card anywhere but my physical address despite me informing them that it will not be delivered. Customer service has been overall unhelpful and the lack of an ability to speak to a person on the phone is frustrating. It’s odd that someone that really wants to give them their business is being stonewalled like this. The investing side of the app works and seems to run well but I am very frustrated with the customer service and process as a whole.
crypto.com,ios,IAmNishaSim,2,2021-02-22 14:48:25,"I’ve had this app for 3 weeks now and have experienced the app taking forever to load on 4 occasions, whether I’m on or off WiFi. When it finally loads it deletes any saved information and you have to wait until I decides it wants to update your account. When I click on profile, it tells me to resubmit my verification information like SSN number and Address. I logged out and tried to logged back in hoping it would fixed the issue, but after inputting my information it takes long to load and after it finished loading it tells me to try again. On the last time I told me to try again, I tried and it tells me to contact customer service. Very frustrated. Other than the loading and crashing issue it’s a good app to use for crypto buying but it’s irritating when you have to take minutes to have access to your information."
crypto.com,ios,mikwehttam,3,2021-01-31 16:48:04,"Love the app, but they’re a little too trigger happy with their fraud prevention, and froze my account after my first transfer. To get it unfrozen involved a kinda silly verification process (pic of me holding my debit card), but it took them all day to even review it. Meanwhile my ETH was stuck in limbo (the froze the transfer too), and it took me five hours to get in touch with customer support. Once they finally responded (very helpful and patient CS rep, especially since I was quite irate), they were able to unlock my account and process my transfer within a couple more hours. I’m all for good fraud protection, but if your standards for freezing someone’s account is so low, then you need to have a much faster way of resolving the issue. Seven hours is an eternity when dealing with cryptocurrency, and I could have lost a lot of money."
crypto.com,ios,jnlcabinets,2,2025-01-26 02:06:53,"I don’t know about this app.  Seems like a scam. Specially when doing the leveraged plays.  When I purchased the contract it would automatically be down $40-60 even if the price was going the direction I was thinking it was going to go.  So if I buy a contract for btc to go up and it’s goin up the second my contract fills. It shows a loss of $40-70 dollars then it will slowly start to go towards the positive.  Also I haven’t been able to find a chart that follows their price action.  My chart on trading view will be going up and on the chart on this app will show the price going down.  And lastly I stopped using the leverage because when the price is moving up the price of my contract wouldn’t increase , even worse, it would sometimes decrease.  Not sure if this makes sense but don’t do leverage plays they will steal your money"

First it wouldn’t let me sell the crypto I had due to “insufficient funds.” Which makes zero sense. I’m looking at it. I know I own X shares of it. Then it would only let me sell some of it a few days later because some of it was “locked.” I got $25 when I first joined years ago. But now apparently I can’t have that money back when I withdraw. Then it said I needed to add a bank account, even though I already linked my account when I joined. When I tried to relink the account it claimed my bank didn’t exist. When I tried a second time it said there was a big error that would take some time to resolve. All in all, it took me multiple days to finally withdraw my money. After this glitchy, buggy, nightmare, I decided to pull ALL my money out. I don’t trust an app this messed up with my cash."

When you deposit money in their “crypto earn” it automatically deducted $20 from the starting value. I could go on and on about how terrible this app is. It’s literally a scam. Now I’m stuck with funds in earn that are slowly depreciating with no way to get them out. Their coin is a joke too. Only reason I even have this app is because they are holding several hundred dollars from me. I can’t understand how anyone can justify this scamming. In what world is a simple withdrawal worth a $40 fee? This app should be taken off the App Store and banned in the U.S. As soon as you download this app you are being exploited, avoid at all costs."

After converting some crypto into USD I tried to withdraw the funds into my bank account. The FAQs states the typical 3 to 5 business days. After eight business days I contacted support and all they had to say was that they were working on the problem and that MANY OTHER USERS ARE EXPERIENCING SIMILAR ISSUES. After another week of me asking daily for an update the only answer I ever received was they are still looking into the problem. Finally received funds in my bank account after almost an entire month and I immediately deleted the app afterwards. Thankfully I didn’t have a large portfolio with them, from what I’m reading others trying to withdraw larger sums are still being told that the issue is being looked into the further"

1. It says 0% fee on credit card in 30 days but I’m not been told I’ll be charged 5% cash advance fee, which means I check bank and realized I got charged $50 from every 1k trades. This is not friendly to a person who is new like me.
2.My $ is losing every time I exchange from one kind Crypto to another and I don’t even know why. 
3. To withdraw, address verification need to be done first. After ONE MONTH my pending address verification finally passed. Customer service respond my message after 2 WEEKS, which takes way too long. I was upset while waiting.
Fees are few percent higher than Coinbase but more altcoins here, and withdraw is much slower. But I do like the notifications I can set on price targets."

Unlike Coinbase I can actually chat within minutes to a very good customer service rep regarding questions or problems. I’m using the 500MCO stake to get 3% MCO back which is amazing. Its a nice hedge against iF the price of MCO drops. It takes while to  figure it all out but you can do a lot with the app and card. Buy Crypto, use the card with fiat currency as a prepaid debit card. They are starting an exchange, stake and earn interest on some cryptos.  This is a very professional company in my experience so far which is a very fresh in the crypto world. And as I said you can actually talk to someone when you need to."

crypto.com,ios,Ifxxckedurbxtch,2,2021-10-30 16:02:04,"Second review. It’s ridiculous that the only way to find out what your average buy price is, by having to add up all your transactions and dividing that by how many coins you have of each crypto. Especially if you’re buying stuff every week, or when the price drops to average down. It should automatically tell you what your average cost is. It should give you all sorts of analytics of each crypto you own. It should tell you how much money ALL TIME you’ve put in so you don’t have to add up hundreds of transactions to find out exactly how much money you are up or down overall. It’s so ridiculous that it only shows you how much percentage it’s moved the last 24 hours. The app would be so much better if it showed more personal stats and let you track your all time stats as well."

It displayed that I was -$165 instead of -$30 as soon as the order was filled. The price for Bitcoin was nowhere near the actual price. When purchasing an updown option they will hit you with a $20-$30 spread going into the trade and again closing your position making it almost impossible to make money. You have to wait for huge runs in your favor to make a profit. It is totally rigged in their favor and when I provided screenshots of their incorrect information they still dismissed me and said nothing was wrong with my trade and that I would not be compensated. STAY AWAY!!!! They just want to steal your money! There are far better platforms out there that have better customer service. Please look elsewhere. Consider yourself warned!

Fast forward 3 months and I am still without a card and told that a new one is on the way. This of course was said without giving an arrival date or tracking number. If there was an issue that is more serious than this I don’t know what I would do."

They also use third a party attach your bank information to their app!  If you stop using this app, change your password immediately.  This is the ONLY app I have ever used, that ask for super personalized information about your bank and your passwords.  It is super scary.  I haven’t tried to sell any crypto, but I am already scared that when I try to cash out my earnings, there will be some weird software glitch preventing me from gaining my profits until its under market.

I’ve received emails instructing me to confirm my phone number. All of which I’ve done. Family and friends have all been approved almost instantly. They provide no way to contact them. When you reply to their emails, you get a kickback email telling you to continue the conversation in their message board. The problem is that conversation is locked leaving you no way to speak with anyone. I suggest using one of the other platforms out there where you’ll be able to receive help when you need it.

They’ve now asked me to re-submit my documents for a 3rd time. It’s been over two weeks trying to get approval. They provide no means of direct contact in order to work through whatever issues they are having. You just have to sit idle and wait. Truly a broken system."

I highly recommended you keep your money away from these people because when you have a problem it will take weeks/months for a response and even at that point your problem won’t be solved. I submitted a support request with multiple questions and received a response weeks later asking if I still needed help. They didn’t even attempt to answer my questions but instead asked if I still needed help. It’s like they assumed I already gave up on them and didn’t want to waste their time with me at that point.

So I tried again a couple days later this time waiting 20 minutes for someone to get back to me. When they did I responded immediately then waited 10 minutes for another response. Again I responded immediately but kept having to wait 10+ minutes for each response. I got 7 responses back within an hour and twenty minutes. By far the worst customer service I’ve ever experienced.

You might also note the duplicate 5* reviews posted under different pseudonyms (I have the screenshots). Go figure. Rest assured, there’s a vague diplomatic response here.

I don’t use any of the card features or anything like that and as far as staking goes, I’ve found there are better interest rates by finding staking pools on the native networks of the crypto being staked. This has competitive rates however compared to other big exchanges however and can be done easily. I had no problems with KYC and account setup.

6. I like the hide your balance feature, that’s cool
7. Getting a statement for tax purposes? Ha, good luck.  In their faq section basically says, you’re on your own.  Great support ...
8. The website is just marketing for the app, there’s no actual website to sign on. Unless I’m missing something then it’s because it’s not easy to find.
9. The giveaways are cool but seem more scammy as there is really no proof of anyone actually winning anything ...
10. They have some work still.  I would suggest you do your due diligence and if you still use them, track your transactions otherwise you’ll have quite the work to do...

Not a bad app but not as great a their marketing makes it out to be. Will I still use them? Yes? Why? Because I have faith they will read this and improve or fall behind and never be # 1."

So then I tried another with a smaller amount just to see if it was my end and y’all took both transactions and never put it through. It’s STILL not in my account! Y’all are quick to take money from people and then not respond to our issues when it comes to this. I have my two receipts too and everything in it to have as documentation. I don’t care if this doesn’t seem much. You guys have been stealing from people. I’ve seen so many reviews that it’s relieving to know I’m not the only one.

Update: I found both purchases on my account had been adjusted. I’m happy it’s there now but it still makes me very uneasy that this happened. I can’t imagine how those who spent way more feel especially if theirs wasn’t resolved."
crypto.com,ios,PonderingBob,2,2024-03-30 15:28:03,"But it’s very spammy. Simple functions are repeatedly blocked by unwanted alerts. I spend more time in the app swiping away all of the different reminders/alerts and function pitches thN I do looking at possible buys. I keep returning but I soent 5k this month on coinbase and nothing in this app. It all boils down to whether or not it will do what I am trying to do, and it isn’t doing it very well.

update in response to dev comments: there’s no need to contact someone via the app’s chat. They received the feedback here and shrugged it off as if the constant ads and alerts are unique to my experience. They did that when they suggested that I go through the app for customer service. We all know the customer service rep can’t do anything but make a comment on my account. Minus another star."

Remember at one time bitcoin wasn’t lower than a dollar and the days of external wallets (though still valued)and mining have changed. We all waste money on little things wether fast food and a drink or something silly we don't need or use. Think about putting some in crypto for the future. Coins like cardano and cro, xrp all have a chance even meme coins like Doge and Shibu Inu can have great returns.

Since then, I have periodically app crashes whenever I try to buy, sell, or transfer crypto. Support takes a lot longer to respond than it used to be, and it’s so frustrating that you just watch the entry price keeps going up or the selling point keeps going down. So why have an exchange when you cannot fulfill the basic needs? Too much opportunity cost. Will be starting to migrate to other exchanges. It’s a shame the cro has great potential. Maybe slow down the marketing until you fix all the issues. I see that many users still have not gotten the cards, and yet you guys keep pushing out ads to attract new users."

I have been using them for years and now when I have issues they are nowhere to he found. I just would like my funds back so I can invest elsewhere. This ridiculous to have wait 6 days for a reply.

Companies like this don’t care about who you are they just see you as a number. Did you know that they can freeze your money anytime they want for any reason they want and they won’t even tell you ahead of time.

Each time I have reached out it take a long time, almost a whole day a few times.

The app shows prices as higher than every other exchange and so when you buy crypto you pay “their” going rate plus fees, which fees are fine I understand. Now here comes the criminal part, when you go to sell, it seems like they only give you the going rate on other exchanges which is a lot less. On top of that, if a coin spikes in price, the sell price doesn’t change. For example, I had a coin that went up 10%, and it was only giving me the option to obtain a one percent gain on my coin if I sold it at that time. You basically can’t make money on this site. I am in the process of switching to coinbase pro. If I were you I’d do the same."

Oh! downloaded CSV file shows i bought crypto but no transactions for when i transferred it to my wallet. kind of strange also when i checked receiving address for ICP address kept blinking in and out like it was having trouble showing address.

Two of my transactions are successful but the balance never updated. My money is god knows where right now.

The replied on Facebook saying “..we are aware of the balances not being reflected accordingly in the USD Fiat Wallet”. They also mention its being worked on without giving a timeline. So I’m not sure when I’ll get access to that money.

He didn’t listen to what I was saying and just kept repeating the same things not relative to what I was saying the issues were.

Then I have to go all over again the steps login > verify email > create account > phone number is recognized. Customer service is a JOKE!!! I couldn’t reset my password, at one point they, asked me to send a screen recording of the steps which I think is very unsecure! They said they’d reach out to me after researching the issue.

First you get ripped off when you buy. They sell to you at a higher price than it it currently trading at. Not to mention there are “fees” on buys and sells. I was trying to sell 40k shares of Vechain at the limit price .0155 and the order sat there for 24 hours and didn’t move. Oh, did I mention I am a trader so I know exactly what I am doing. I have access to level two trades and liquidity that no one else can see. So I thought I would just place a market sell order to get rid of it and because there was plenty of buyers. The market order sold for .140  at $55 loss even though there were plenty of buyers at a higher price and tack on the selling “fees”. I’ll be trading with a real broker from now on."

Unfortunately many of their functions do not work due to a poorly designed  app, complaints about app functionality issues were met with copy page responses that had nothing to do with the problem I was having, and when a person who could actually answer my question contacted me 12 days later the answer was basically… deal with it. They said there was no plans nor any idea of a plan to actually make the function usable. If you are looking to trade crypto, find a different app that actually has functions that work. 

TLDR: they have terrible support (xfinity/Comcast), functions that don’t work and they refuse to even fix. Go elsewhere."

Just wired $ to my fiat wallet for first time. The app is barely working - way too slow. I have been trying to buy crypto, and it won’t let me - says insufficient funds despite plenty of fund that were wired in. Maybe it’s just chance, but this isn’t good. They essentially have a large amount of my money and I can’t buy anything at the moment. And it is a great buy opportunity right now. Totally disappointed."

Eth market limited and stable coins are limited to what you can sell/buy and transfer. That CRO coin can purchase any and everything.  Keep your apologies and sorry to you and your garbage app. After a good 6 months use and réalise the drawbacks, you begin to become annoyed with this crap. Save yourself some headaches use UNISWAP OR ANYTHING THAT IS A TRUE DECENTRALIZED PLATFORM! This is not the one."
crypto.com,ios,MT111111133333777777,3,2020-05-24 06:09:21,"So many things things wrong here, at least for my area in USA. 

“Exchange” won’t work, which means one cannot place limit buys/sells. 
All market buys are +1% in addition to the added cost on the platform as opposed to the actual market value.

I don’t know about everyone else, but I detest starting an investment at a loss. This is what will always happens here. 

The navigation through the app is extremely tedious. 

The graph interface is not much to write home about. No bars, 8hour is the minimum amount of time. No zoom, no volume changes. 
App will not tell you the cost per coin but the total of the purchase. This has the effect of hiding the added value they are placing on the coins with respect to the actual market value. I much prefer to see how much I’m purchasing each share/coin for. 

My recommendation is to wait until the kinks are worked out. 

I will increase my rating one the price per coin is adequately reflected in a transaction. 

I will further increase the rating once the app actually has limit sell/buy capabilities.

Overall stressful experience."

I was told to do the same thing over twenty times and they keep telling me try again in a couple of days which is now almost two weeks. I went on twitter and got a quick response just for them to tell me open the chat which just stopped working. If u want to keep your hair just use Coinbase or FTX. Everyone seems like a bot or from some other country reading a script and disregard anything u are explaining to them.

crypto.com,ios,Joel_Davis,1,2019-09-17 12:02:59,"I was one of the first to sign up for early access when the MCO app first launched, and I already have the red metal card from staking 50 MCO for 6 months. I was really looking forward to using my card I waited so long for, but it seems I shouldn’t have gotten my hopes up.

First off, topping up the card is a nightmare. It never should have launched in its current state. It requires that you wire money from your bank to another using checking and routing number (all US establishments charge a transfer fee which costs around $35 at most banks). So each time I’d want to top up my card, it’d cost $35.. not cool. 

Beyond that – as if that part isn’t enough to steer away 99% of potential users – there still isn’t a way to export a transaction summary for tax purposes. So if you do actually load the card and use it often, then you literally have to write out each transaction and deposit on your own. 

I can’t imagine there are many people out there actually using this right now. I mean who wants to waste their time entering each transaction / MCO reward deposit into a spreadsheet to bring to their tax advisor when tax return time comes around? Fix these major issues and I’ll update this review. Until then, I guess I’ll just be using my Apple card."

Also doesn’t tell you about the chunk of change you lose when you withdraw crypto from the app. Fix your options table and make it more accurate. Other than that it feels like a scam. You would probably attract much more people to the app considering you guys are one of the few that hasn’t been hit with a fraud inconvenience. The app is ok if your only holding long term and don’t care about the spread or delay. If your a day trader or anything like it. This ain’t exactly it.
crypto.com,ios,jdhdhde,1,2024-12-11 03:18:01,I’d give negative stars but as it is ppl filter out the one stars as being anomalous. This is not an exchange.. this is a site that trades on bait and switch you buy at the rolling price and sell at an “average” that is quite a bit off. Where does the difference go? I bet their pockets. Don’t get me started on derivatives leveraging market.. again they take an average and you strike based on some made up amount which is unrelated to the actual amount.. so its more like a game of chance where the house tends to win. Boy do they have this rip off game to an art.. It seems like actual fraud since they allegedly take the averages you aren’t actually able to willfully take advantage of the momentum of a price change as they seem to be choosing the most advantageous price points..

Now everything i own is worth half less or even a quarter. Also now that everything is cheap and low and cant add money to buy cheap. Upon signing up make sure to not overcharge your cc or debit. Beacuse of the long verifying proccess between every purchase its too slow to buy when u want to and will say the price timed out. Then it will charge your cc even for denied purchases. I was only planning on adding 500 dollars but after all my denied attempts processed three days later i had 3000 $ worth of a coin that was already pumped and dumped so I immediately lost money when it processed.

They should be more honest with the price, you can sell a crypto and with the hidden fee it can drop 10% and you still won’t be able to buy back what you had so they make it hard for regular traders it’s extremely disappointing they they are practically robbing you I want to like them but this is what keeps me from that it has to be like 35% or more move to make anything with this site so I would encourage new users to really look at what they say your crypto is worth compared to what they are giving you then try to buy back your position and you can’t even after it drops"

When I reached out to customer service there is no immediate response, and the only explanation they can give is the system is slow due to high demand.

Also I made a purchase when Doge hit an all time high and my card was charged 3x but I never received all of my coins. Can not find a way to contact a human about the matter. I have disputed it with my bank and am still in the process well over a month later.

If anyone can give me any insight on what I can do to change this, please do so before I abruptly delete this app and I’m no longer a customer of y’all or a crypto trader/ investor."

The majority of purchases I try to make do not process correctly and I get a generic error message that says to contact using the help chat via the app. After the contacting customer service via the help chat I receive a automated message that states that the error I am getting is most likely due to my card/bank declining the transaction, this is not the case. After several hours I finally received a message from a customer service rep that stated I should “try using another payment method or just wait a few days and try again”. Crypto is to volatile to wait a few days. I need my purchase to go through the moment I want to purchase, not days later."

Had to reach out to figure out how to get money in the app, so that was cumbersome and annoying, but got that done. Now it’s requiring 2 factor authorization, and cant get that to work either. Does not work as the Step by step guide says, so now im going to have jump through hoops and reach out to get this part fixed too.

I do still recommend this app, but just be prepared for extra work to get up and running with it…
I would give 3.5 stars but since i cant, its getting 3 not 4 from me. Definitely not in the 5 star range yet."
crypto.com,ios,bwjakc fb,2,2021-10-11 12:28:24,"Been using for about a year if not more. If you’re not a fan of fees I’d definitely move on. When you buy a coin it’s magically a higher price when you go to pay for it. That’s on top of a 3% fee for cards. Then when you go to sell that same coin, it’s magically way lower than the actual market price. Funny how that works? They take so much money for gas fees, etc. I bought a coin at its high, and somehow the sale shows it higher than its all time high??? How does that work? And then if I go to sell it, the app is taking another $10-$12 off of the total balance of the coin. Basically anytime you have a balance over $1200, expect it to be $70-$100 lower depending on how many coins you have once you sell it. Amazing how that works."

Biggest drawbacks for me...The main one is prices. Often times the price I see is not the price I pay when I want to purchase. Also, the price I see is typically not the price I am allowed to sell at (I almost always sells for lower than the price I see). That’s really disappointing to me. 

What’s more, there are price discrepancies in 3 different places. The front page price is different from the price you see when you click a coin, is different from the prices you see on the “tracking” tab."

When I signed up, I couldn’t believe all of the information they want: a selfie, your drivers license, and bank passwords and routing numbers. I got cold feet and didn’t complete the process. I asked several times for this company to delete my information and account, and they refused. I would say that is highly suspect. My last point is this: be very careful giving away all of your most valuable information. Identity theft is real. You can wake up tomorrow and have your entire bank account wiped out, and what are you going to say in your defense: That you gave all of your personal and banking info to an anonymous crypto app. Don’t be so naïve and stupid. Wake up. Don’t be a statistic. The world is ruled by scam artist."

If you really want something to frustrate you and waste your time, try asking their support team to help you get through. They’ll suggest all kinds of things for you to do and all sorts of hoops for you to jump through rather than try to fix it on their end, because these are a bunch of people who don’t know what they’re doing.

I have $30 in Bitcoin, and I can’t transfer it out, I can’t sell it for another crypto, I can’t access MY MONEY no matter what I do!!

This is the only platform I’ve had problems with and those problems are big enough for me not to want to be a part of it. There are so many superior platforms then this one. You’ll figure that out once you’re treated the same way I was. 4.6 rating is wayyyy to generous. I’m sure they have ppl leaving fake reviews to boost their rating. Good luck 👍🏽

So then I wanted to move all my coins to that app but then i got a new phone and forgot about the 2FA so I wanted to get it reset.

I have contacted the support but no one got back to me after more than 72 hours. I checked Reddit and found out that many other users are experiencing the same email issue and also being ignored by the support team for more than 2 weeks.

For example there’s no way to see all of your gains/losses for the day and inception to date, total current value, and cost basis for all your coins on the same screen. I’ll definitely be looking for another app to transfer to. Note as well that most of the reviews are fake.

Here is an example. I sold ATOM for $34.7 but in the buy page it had a price of $35.5. That is a fee difference of 2.3%. That is a very high fee compared to 0.1% that BinanceUS charges. I found a page on their website that has a fee table but deceptive as well. According to the table, they charge a max fee of 0.4%. That would have been reasonable fee if It were true.

If I see a mint on Polygon and only have Solana I can swap one for the other and still make it to mint on time. Not wealthy or even comfortable financially.

The interface could use a little more friendly facelift for novice users to help navigate the app better but after investing some in exploring the app, you’ll find your way around.

The only reason I even tried this app instead of Coinbase was because I wanted to buy WIF. I definitely got some, but not at the price I wanted. The order didn’t execute on the real time price. It was basing it off of whatever the price they came up with on here was. I’m actually dreading what the process will look like to sell it. Not impressed at all. How is anybody happy with this app? I’m baffled."
crypto.com,ios,Adoniswells,1,2024-03-20 16:12:48,"This is my first time reviewing any app. This company is nearly a scam at this point. I’ve lost over $900 to this company and no one will help out. I’ve been waiting for over a month for someone to get back to me from their support team. The up and down strike option is exceptionally a big scam. Even though the price was greater than at the point in time in line with my contract position, they still took my money. I have screenshot of the price at the time the contract closed but no one would respond to me. This is about to be a class action lawsuit as I have seen a lot of people that have lost a lot of money to this platform due to this manipulative practices.
Payment and transfer fees are exceptionally higher than any other trading platform. Avoid this app at all cost!!!"

The time you want to buy when the market is really down these apps screw you because  they don’t want you to buy at cheap price. Looks sketchy to me. Also not getting any referral bonus for my referrals to my friend. Another app that makes you feel frustrated, cheated and want you just get out of it. Not even a proper customer service number to contact. Felt cheated here 😠🥺"
crypto.com,ios,Love5412,1,2021-09-12 23:05:24,They sent me a physical card and when I tried to activate it through the app it was already activated the pin was nonexistent you can’t even change the pin inside of the app also when you go to any store it instantly ask for a pin so that comes with issues. Also it doesn’t make sense that I cannot transfer the money back into my cryptocurrency that should be something that is implemented but probably not gonna happen. Furthermore I feel like this app is not ready for the world or the app is not ready all the way I feel like this app should be able to be diverse where it can switch hands back-and-forth with currency and physical money but it does not know how to do that and I highly recommend not getting this card.
crypto.com,ios,Gingerslayer113,1,2021-05-05 16:11:25,"The only thing I ever used this app for was purchasing crypto. I was informed via email my account was terminated with zero reasoning. When I tried to work with them to reopen it they said they wouldn’t do it. When I asked about the funds in my wallet they basically just said it belongs to them now.

I might be a one off case, but the bottom line is that they are snakes. Pure thieves. They can terminate anyone’s account whenever they please with zero reasoning. It’s in the terms and conditions. You’re better off using coin base or literally any other wallet.

After looking at some of the other reviews, it seems to have happened to other people. Don’t listen to all these other 5 star reviews. This company does not care about its clients, and will easily rob you blind."

I still cannot figure out how to just sell out and take my loss already and never use this app again. I tried customer service but I’ve been waiting over a week for one simple message back on how to sell. So I’ve just been losing even more money than I should’ve, when all I wanted to do was sell at the beginning instead of transferring. Terrible app, worse design, do not ever get this app, if I could do less than 1 star I would. Probably even worse than robinhood in my opinion because at least I could still sell on that app. Do not download this app it is only a headache."

So I called my bank and got an account activity letter showing everything they wanted. They still rejected my deposit . I requested a refund immediately . It’s has been over a week I still have no refund in my account . I email them and for 3 days they say it has been sent to my bank. Still no refund . I email 4 more days and all of a sudden someone emails me and says they are working on it . This company will steal your money . I have filed a report with the FBI and the SEC as of today.

crypto.com,ios,DueceHussle,5,2021-04-02 03:30:23,"I had to write a review. This is the easiest place to buy some of the mid sized cryptos like NEO & ICX outside of Binance. Because I live in Texas, Binance isn’t available so I can settle for this and sleep well at night. Binance is superior, Coinbase is superior for the big coins & this is what you need for mid to small sized coins. That’s why I named it the silver package because binance would be the platinum package & coinbase the gold package. This is inferior to those two

If you’re new to crypto & don’t understand you can’t swap coins you have to sell ETH to BTC or USDT etc then this isn’t the place to learn. If you’re familiar, this is an easy place to navigate"
crypto.com,ios,Spydermonkey199,1,2021-05-20 02:23:45,"Reasons:
1. Can’t do limit orders(this alone should turn most away).
2. Servers are big enough for the amount of users. Was trying to sell at the start of a dip multiple times, which is when other active users will also be trading, and the servers were overloaded to the point that I couldn’t get a simple sell at market price order to go through for 70 minutes which turned my $80 dollar loss into a $250 dollar loss.
3. The exchange rates are not accurate, seeming to always skew against you
4. It seems like they skim extra off the top of each trade (can’t prove this in anyway, just my personal observation)

Positives
1. 30 days no fees
2. User friendly for the most basic crypto traders who have just started for their first time(anyone who has traded any other securities won’t be happy with how limiting they have made it)

Side note: if you have never traded anything before and this is your first time opening a crypto account this app could work well for you, but within a month or even a week you will want more capabilities for trading so I would recommend just starting on a better app. There are plenty!"

They want a cancellation of dispute of the charges.  My bank has already refunded my money. I have sent them a summary of the dispute but it is not good enough. They want a copy of a letter that doesn’t exist and will hold my money hostage till get get it.   This is not right and a total scam.   Please do yourself a favor and learn from my loss.

Support claims they take security seriously but their logic when it comes to security is severely flawed! That’s like inviting someone to your home, shooting them in the leg when they enter, ask for their ID, then apologizing later, claiming you just take security seriously!

I had to stay up until 2 AM just so I can actually talk to them even tho I made a request around 9-10 AM the previous day.

It’s as though they give you the lowest sell price for the session and the highest buy price. I transferred all of my money off once I closed my positions. This was also expensive, even using CRO, and the amount received doesn’t match the amount sent minus the withdrawal fees.

Plus they have many different cryptos you can choose from, unlike some other platforms which only have the higher profile cryptos. Like the “green arrow” one. So far, piece of cake!

This company used to be really good but it’s just one restriction after the next with new T&C’s and app updates every other week.

After some success, I then tried to send money through my Fiat wallet to my personal USD bank account. It has now been over two months and I still have not received my funds in my account. I have reached out to their customer service chat support numerous times now and I still haven’t received a response.  Very disappointing and untrustworthy.

Maybe it’s my cards but none of them want to work and always say “authorization failed” (yes I have enough money for the transaction).

I’ve already made money on this platform and purchased a drink with the card. 

Don’t get me wrong, it’s something you have to really mess around with to fully understand the functionality. DONT FORGET, if you want to send someone coins you have to download the DeFi wallet. 

All in all I’m excited to see where crypto and this platform go in the future. Wherever it is I’ll be there to support."
crypto.com,ios,DirtyNut,1,2021-03-09 01:03:02,"This is by far the worst exchange app I have used to date and I’ve tried many. All though they support a large number of cryptos, it has many draw backs.

1. You can not place buy and sell limit orders.
2. It’s nearly impossible to ascertain how much profit you’ve made, you need to do the math yourself based on previous transactions. This is fine when you buy BTC once but if you buy it regularly you will have to go back and forth through trans actions to calculate your own P&L.
3. The app is extremely convoluted and requires multiple steps just to see purchased and traded transactions.
4. The profit and loss is calculated on the market price not what you bought it for.
So for example if you bought LTC at $140 on Monday and it tanked to $100 on Tuesday and then back up to $115 on Wednesday it will show that you have a 15% profit when in reality you’ve lost money. This is majorly broken P&L

There is much more but these are deal breakers for me, I will be transferring out multilateral they correct the ability to see profit and loss based on what you bought in on not the markets profit and loss. 

The app has potential but not until this simple fundamental ability is fixed."

They offer the easiest and cheapest way to purchase crypto, securely store crypto, stake crypto, and offer a debit card to spend your crypto with great rewards. The only thing that is missing to make this app perfect is the ability to instantly deposit or  withdrawl fiat currency for a low rate similar to what Cash app and Square offers, but I believe that service is coming soon."

crypto.com,ios,andrew47293,1,2022-09-28 02:49:12,First problem was the complete inability to connect my bank account despite multiple tries. Finally I was able to deposit using Apple Pay. I set up a 3 month locked stake with USDC and got a few dollars after it ended. Today I am trying to withdraw it and I’m discovering it is absolutely impossible to do. The best option I’ve come up with is transferring the USDC to my coinbase account (which is MUCH EASIER to use and operate) and then withdrawing it from there which takes about 10 seconds. I also discovered that the fee to withdraw my USDC is significantly more than what I earned in staking for THREE MONTHS so essentially I deposited my money for a quarter of a year just to get even less back. Will absolutely never use this app again.
crypto.com,ios,Redcap3000,1,2021-06-21 00:47:30,"I’ve been using this application for over a year and as of late it has become barely usable as most screens to buy/sell/deposit and transfer routinely clear themselves preventing one from actually interacting with number fields or buttons while the screen remains mostly blank.

Frequent updates where ‘bug fixes and optimizations’ occur do nothing.

When I do manage to get through often I will receive a general error; sometimes even if the transaction was successful; sometimes resulting in the same transaction occurring multiple times.

This added to the very high fees to sell crypto makes the application frustrating to use.

The applications basic verbiage (fiat wallet vs ‘card’ and the term ‘top up’, crypto earn vs crypto stake) creates a confusing landscape unique to this platform that can easily lock an uninformed user into maintaining an untradable balance until more crypto or cash is deposited while the user hopes they are properly using the appropriate products to unlock the features they value the most. If they fail they are easily locked into 3 month stakes in CRO token while the value plummets."

Always do your own research before investing and only invest what you are willing to use. I will most likely use this app on occasion but will be using other platforms like coin gecko instead.

The newest problem I have is that I cannot download cdc’s latest version due to my travel and being in a different country. Not having a web based version like Gemini and coinbase is an additional problem.

Bitcoin will take off again soon, I started with crypto 4 years ago but was a mutual fund and stocks fan for many years. This new age with digital etc is here to stay. I’m still surprised that slot of Americans are afraid to invest into Cryptocurrency. Especially with companies are no longer giving pension plans and social security could be on a blank. Something is better then nothing. You guys have a great weekend and thanks keeping out accts safe."
crypto.com,ios,meb1453,5,2021-08-17 14:55:15,So getting setup is a little challenging but all the Crypto apps are the same getting setup. So once your setup the next thing is depositing your money. So pretty much all us banks will not let you setup your debit or checking account. So you can set up though your bank ACH but it takes days to get you money deposited into your account. I was able to used my PayPal debit card and got to used my fund right  away. So if you have a PayPal debit card you can start trading the same day. So I hope this helps.
crypto.com,ios,mkwest2108,1,2022-12-15 14:36:45,"The app works fine but it is in no way intuitive.  Customer service is not responsive and English seems to be a second language leading to problems with understanding some of the finer point.  They are also not on US time so responses often take overnight. Rather than guide you on a function or process they send info sheets that do not address the issue directly and contain extraneous info you have to sort thru.  The answers are not clear.

The company restricts portions of the app and your account that impact the ability to fund and will not tell the customer why. Just that an “internal company decision was made.”

The app works, the company is to be avoided unless you get a rush from high risk and being frustrated not related to investing."

Highly disappointed and highly recommend you not to waste your time and efforts. Help desk, chat, or customer service is by far one of the worst I’ve ever seen. I’ve been locked out of my account for 5 days and changing my password doesn’t do anything. THE WORST Crypto or NFT app. Save your money…

crypto.com,ios,Queen KCrypto,2,2021-12-05 15:28:47,So I like the features in this app. And they even offer 30 days no credit card transaction fees for purchases. It has not worked one time. I’ve tried multiple cards. They say it says declined yet the pre approval test debits hit my account. No reason given whatsoever when I reach out to support other than “try a different card” or “use ACH function and link bank account”. What is the point of the promo offer if it never works?? And secondly my cards work on Coinbase perfectly. Never an issue. What a shame. I was really going to give this app a go…but after this struggle you really think I’m going to link an actual bank account? Lol. No way.

CryptoCom has been reliable for paying weekly groceries, cell phone and most other expenses.

The only negative so far is that the app locks up when attempting to remove coins from the flexible deposit.  I have to borrow my wife's phone.  All other features of the app work great and the MiniPad5 screen size is really convenient."

crypto.com,ios,TomStev,3,2021-05-24 17:56:47,"A pretty good trading platform that offers a debit card.  This would be my preferred trading platform except the fees.

Transferred LTC (cheaper gas fees) to another account and they charged a $25 gas fee, less than $1 of that was the ACTUAL gas fee charged by the network.  
  I don’t mind paying reasonable fees and I would still trade heavily on this platform at the current high fees IF the were transparent about it.  Under FEES when you buy, sell, trade, etc, it will always say FEe: $0.00.  Instead the fees are tacked in to the totals and this is dishonest.

This is ridiculous tht this company holds your money and crypto hostage. They are just as terrible as Coin base. All of these crypto platforms just want to hold your money to show growth and for them to profit. How are you any different from a traditional bank?!?!

I can’t chose your price to sell your assets. They will force you to go with the price they want you to sell at. If you get tricked like myself to stake or earn interest, once you complete your 3 months term, they will offer you .02% for the same asset that was 11%. Then when you decide to withdraw and transfer or sell, they will charge you high fee to get their money back they paid you as interest and then some.

If I try to sell my crypto, the price they’ll give me does not reflect the current market price by like 30-60 dollars. There’s no customer service to call as they likely just want you to spend your money and have the hardest time doing it.

Essentially, they are losing too much money on the rewards program and as a result they are trying to come up with these silly interventions to prevent a loss of money.

Can’t check my investments, can’t see my balance, can’t even activate the Visa card I ordered! 
Using the “virtual card” I did manage to make one purchase, before the app went to crap. Bought a grill, got a dollar store ring and a 50 cent chain, can’t contact anyone about that either. Lucky for me I used PayPal, but the money, if recovered will be back to this account, that I cannot see or use. Might as well not get it back, honestly. Stay away! Stay far away from this app!!"

Now it said it will take a few days to approve because of high volume requests. I do not recommend giving all your info unless they improve their security and also be careful about their privacy policy since they state they can do whatever they feel like with your information. Since this app is in China I would not recommend using it.  Now I will have to closely monitor my information and lock my identity.  Reading the last few negative comments, just be aware!"

Again, the $70 was below the $100 minimum. I can’t even take back the money I put into it originally... and I cannot make the purchase I wanted to make. My money is just sitting there being held hostage. I wasn’t planning to use this to invest, just to make online purchases with BTC.

crypto.com,ios,terrible odds dont play,5,2021-11-17 07:53:05,Everything about this app is great the earn feature is amazing get paid just to hold your crypto here. Lower fees than Coinbase for purchasing. The new missions are cool just for free crypto for making purchases. The only downside I have is that a card reissue costs $50 no matter what. I upgraded to a new rewards tier and a new card would be $50. This is the only downside otherwise this is my go to app for crypto. In the long run $50 is a small amount compared to what I will be earning from this app and the cro staking.

Yet, I believe the customer service here is bad. To begin with, i have upgraded my card three times. The second time I upgraded the card was close to two months now. I have yet to receive it. I upgraded to tier 3, approximately 3 weeks ago. 
I’m a huge Traveller, but I cannot take advantage of my benefits, making me lose money. I have been to Colorado, Las Vegas, Texas and Im going to NY, DR and Colombia. Im losing a lot of money. 

I understand there is a large demand with the growth of crypto and that you are located in Europe, but this has been nothing but a bad experience when it comes to customer service. I attempt to chat, I don’t get a respond for 24-48 hours. My business partner has been using the card and there has been an additional 20% charge for the use of the card since it’s still considered as a “prepaid debit card” which i don’t understand why."

I have started using it less since this is an issue. The message should appear once and thats it. No need to pop up after each click. Please fix this.

I guess I’ll stick with them for awhile considering they have me by the neck, but as soon as i come up with more funds to buy just enough to reach the minimum to transfer out I will do so.

The stickers are starting to peel off making it hard to swipe my card. I reached out to “customer support” and after 3 days they told me I would have to pay $50 for a new card. $50 for a piece of metal that was poorly made.

Would be nice to just be able to buy it on your app.

Is there any place to submit feedback to request that Million Token be added to your app? That would save me some extra steps with buying.

Thanks!"

However, with the new update it seems to be running a bit faster but now my screen brightness is extremely low even though I’m not turning down my brightness. Something is causing this app to run at half since the update this morning. However, I would strongly suggest this app to anyone looking to get into cryptocurrency. There are so many more options for coin than the other competition and it feels safer."
crypto.com,ios,Jbstetlling,1,2021-09-30 15:35:27,"The app will not let me withdraw or transfer out crypto; very easy to deposit of course, but now it’s essentially stuck. I’ve done everything the support has asked five times over and glitches will not let me withdraw crypto and I’ve read on forums that it’s affected many other users as well. The agents continue to give lip service that “the team is working on a fix”, but I think that’s highly unlikely because this issue is no where on their incident page and they just keep repeating the same stuff over and over. The whole app is glitchy overall. Go with another exchange, this one isn’t worth it and you might essentially lose access to your crypto."

The built in support on the app doesn't work. The email account they provide for support is unreachable. I've waited for 2 days in the online support chat on their website with nothing but a bot that has linked articles that aren't helpful. For a service that's supposed to have over 10 million people, their customer support is close to zero. I've lost a good chunk of my investment due to being locked out of my account and no help from support. 1/10 do not get this. Use literally anything else!"

There is a glitch I noticed. I bought a single ONE coin and right when I purchased it said my coin had lost 7% right when I bought it. Even though in those few moments the price rose .06 cents. 

I also enjoy the convenience of their crypto card. I can’t tell you about the other card perks because I got the basic midnight blue card which is 1%. Back on everything. If you want an easy way to buy crypto using fiat or your visa/MasterCard this is it."

They demanded that I give biometric data. I refused. I don’t give biometrics on my iPhone and I didn’t even have 20 minutes to explore the app before I was kicked out. What an unfortunate waste of time. I thought I would have a great experience, but the biometric demands and constant lock outs wasted so much valuable time.

crypto.com,ios,Part time trader 123,1,2023-12-19 11:38:17,"I downloaded this app a couple of years ago and just recently I began to start trading on the ups and downs of the crypto market. I began to notice if a token price was showing 5.56 for example and I was trying to sell the tokens, the sale price would be much lower than the market price. For example, that token for 5.56 would show a sale price of 5.25 instead of the 5.56 and if I wanted to buy it within the same minute, the purchase price would be 5.75. I understand there is going to be some discrepancy with the time frame but it should not vary that much within seconds of the market updating the app. I just suggest doing your research and looking for other areas so you don’t lose money to hidden fees."

Now this app works, but there is an over abundance of security measures that don’t really protect but make things more difficult. I enjoy 2FA, but this app is very clunky as you need to enter 3 passcodes really to complete any menial task. To withdraw is ridiculous, some bank accounts (major banks included) are very limited in features. Withdrawals are delayed and they lack many simple features I use on others. I will absolutely not be using this app going forward and sticking to CB and BN."

It took me two day to figure out how to transfer my money into my bank account and after all that I lost over 50% of my money. I’m not a generous in crypto but I am under apprenticeship and I have used multiple app for trading and this is by far the worst for beginners. If you are looking to use this app I would recommend putting in a bunch of research in it and know you’re way around it forwards and back. I do think this app could be good if they made it easier to transfer money from you’re bank account and into you’re bank account. Hop this helps.

Wrong. I install the app, submit my verification, select my country, upload my ID only for you guys to hit me with a “unavailable in your country” — then why in the world would you have Angola on the list and even send verification codes if in the end I can’t access anything because you decide not to include Angola in?

If you are the company who took my money then it’s your responsibility to give it back when requested. This should be illegal.  This is a scam. Do not fall for it. Do not use this service.

This app is terrible and far too complicated when it should be a simple process to cash out like any other crypto app. Also I sent my ID as one of the verified documents for “proof of address” and got denied, so people can just spend as much money as they want on it but can’t withdraw their own funds? That’s crazy sounds like a scam to me. Extremely unprofessional I’d never recommend this to anybody."

Once I reached out to customer service the said “we decided you no longer meet our criteria so we closed your account. Would you like to withdraw you funds?” What a bunch of crap when I asked why I didn’t meet the criteria they said they can’t tell me. So then I was forced to transfer my crypto instead of selling it because they locked my account but they took 50% of my crypto as a fee for transferring out of their app. Essentially they stole from me by forcing me out with no reason. And of course they waited till crypto was down and my account was way down.

I tried contacting the customer service to tell them they scammed me and they said the price of the coins were changing. All those transactions were one after another.

But I made a sell on some crypto and it automatically goes to there coin. 1) I didn’t ask for that and it should have gone to a cash balance. 2) the limits they have on other crypto purchases makes it impossible to withdraw from there coin and purchase another. Can’t even buy a single coin if you wanted. So the major problem here is the limits they have on crypto purchases and at the same time charge a percent on trades. If you are charging me, I definitely should be able to spend my money anyway I see fit without any sort of limits.  I will be cashing out and moving to another app. I’m not charged to buy stocks and very rarely have a limit on what I can purchase. None of my other tools control my money like this. No no no"

But then I quickly realized that the app charged a few cents to a few dollars (depending on the price) of every coin. Whats more amazing is that this includes the desktop version. So it became clear the no fees thing is just a scam and they’re just hiding them.

Second, when I try to sell my crypto for fiat or a stable coin, they’re taking around 5% of it. Which is absolutely an outrageous fee.

Third I had an instance where I tried to buy and the app crashed. I received no confirmation that it went through, it didn’t show in my account, didn’t reflect on my bank (at first), so I put through another. That one went through as normal. TWO DAYS later they withdraw the money and give me the coin at a price 15% higher than when I submitted the order.

Now I’m sitting with $11 in fiat on my account after transferring out my assets. And guess what, I can’t pull it out unless it’s $100.

When you click contact support it takes you back to the beginning of the loop.  There is no human chat or way of talking to a human. They waste money on marketing there platform  instead of hiring people to support there users. I’ll never leave Coinbase again.  I seen the commercial and it looked ok.

They will literally do whatever they can to avoid you withdrawing any money you put in, and have so many different steps you have to get through to finally withdraw your money.

I’ve lost so many opportunities thanks to this mediocre app, it’s not even funny!!  It takes an eternity to do anything!!"
crypto.com,ios,Clyde Henglson,1,2021-02-25 23:50:25,First off I decided to try this app since Robinhood has been pulling some shady stuff and these guys are far worse. It’s real easy to deposit money in but getting it out is literally impossible. I have tried to pull my money out and it just keeps saying “pending” in the fiat wallet which has been like that for way over two weeks at this point. I have messaged customer service seriously I mean this when I say it 10 times and gotten ZERO response. These people are literally holding MY money hostage and won’t return it to me. I am going to find out how to report this platform and see what higher action I can take because I honestly feel I am being robbed and my money that rightfully belongs to me is being kept from me.
crypto.com,ios,Jaredbsanchez,5,2024-01-15 00:08:32,"This app has been a real treasure, and I don’t mean all gains. The tutorials and learning center articles are well written and easy to understand in a non-condescending style. And the fact that you get at least either an whole or partial CRO token each 25 days (Missions feature; just check in), it’s the app that keeps on giving.

If you remember anything from this review, just think FREE CRO; every 25 days just for checking in.

Prough Bonough"
crypto.com,ios,Hunter1588,3,2024-04-26 20:04:40,"I like this app, it does what I need it to do. However, every time I try to check it there is ALWAYS an update first (Twice just this week). It is without fail and this is the first time i’ve ever wrote a review for an app. This may seem trivial but the amount of times it’s happened to me when i’m quickly trying to check my coins is far too many. Obviously apps need to be updated so if possible please try to save updates for larger bug fixes/patches and release them at once rather than tiny updates every few days or week."
crypto.com,ios,Roger08/29/1998,1,2024-04-04 08:54:44,I invested X amount of money into a certain crypto thinking that I could easily cash out when I wanted to. Boy was I wrong. You can’t even cash out with a valid bank account. For one you need at least 0.112 bitcoin to transfer to cash app not only that but it has been giving me a hard time to use my chime account to withdraw. Also when you buy at a certain amount it automatically makes you buy a higher start point. (Example: if you buy a share for 1.29 usd you’re automatically buying that share at 1.5 usd. And I have a pretty up to date phone. iPhone 14) Literally the worst crypto app I have ever used. Take my advice and go elsewhere to invest. Absolute garbage platform

There is no way to contact them other than email.  I have repeatedly emailed.  They usually send me a canned statement telling me to wait longer.  They have also requested videos with my front and side profile. Speaking of a specific date and holding my id card. Since then I have had other issues.  I still have not had access to my account.  I believe they are using,selling, and stealing information.  I have since done internet searches and discovered multiple people with same complaints and complaints are increasing.  Do not use this app!!!!!"

First of all they did charge an up charge for my purchase, but that’s not the worst part.  When you purchase and transfer out to a wallet they really stick it to you. Out of $200, only $164 of Bitcoin was deposited.  There are so many better apps to use to purchase crypto.  I’ll bet the guys giving them good reviews work for them.  Save your money go elsewhere."

crypto.com,ios,Pulan671,1,2022-02-12 22:07:13,"This app doesn’t work the way it’s supposed to. I made a significant purchase, and right as I made some money I tried to withdraw the difference. However, I couldn’t link my bank account (somehow it was super easy to put in money but not take out). So I consulted with customer service, and they always give solutions. If only the solutions actually worked. It’s been months of going back and forth with customer service, as you can guess, the stocks I bought have gone down significantly in value. And I still can’t link my bank account. I’ve been requesting a refund but of course I’m getting the run around from customer service. This app is a complete rip off and waste of time."

Tried to log in, got sent a verification email, when you try to click the verification it redirects you to “create” an account rather than “login” - basically a bug that ensures you cannot ever log back into the account. Clever scammin, I’ll give them that. And before some buffoon tries to tell me I needed to click “login” not “create account” I did indeed do that because I have more than one brain cell and every verification email still redirected me to create an account in a way that makes it impossible to log back into my account to make my sale."

It lags so bad and does not refresh prices until minutes later. It’s so slow now. Very bad update and needs to immediately go back under maintenance for fix. It’s unfortunate because I really like using this exchange as it has so much potential and has so far been awesome but this new update is beyond garbage

crypto.com,ios,Zaidanator,2,2024-05-23 01:32:42,"The cons: Price alert notifications don’t always push through. You are paying 8-15% in fees so whatever coin you purchase you need to see it have at least a 15% gain from your purchase price to make it worth your trouble. Their shown price for a coin is different than the actual world market value. The unrealized profit doesn’t include fees so you will probably lose money the first time you sell because you are lead to believe you made a profit. 

The pros: wide selection of coins, detailed info about your investment, and good app if you know nothing about coins and want something for a long term investment."
crypto.com,ios,Luchyie,1,2023-04-25 19:30:21,"I normally never leave reviews on any app, but this company has disrespected and disappointed me on a new level.

Not to mention that for some reason in the emails they kept transferring me to a new employee, which is VERY FISHY. Use any other crypto app/website, just do not use this one unless you want your money to be absolutely frozen (likely will never be able to withdraw mine, at least what's left of it)."

I’ve been trying to contact the customer service and they honestly do NOT understand how this network operates and tell me to continue to wait. Meanwhile, I’m losing money as the price of the crypto is declining. As I needed these funds ASAP I’m insanely upset with this whole application as it is it’s one job to be able to buy and sell cryptocurrency. If it cannot perform even the most trivial tasks, it serves no purpose to myself and I warn others to err on the side of caution before proceeding to trust them with their crypto transactions."
crypto.com,ios,Stellexx,1,2022-04-27 03:30:06,This is my personal experience so I can not speak whether other have the same experience but this is yet another platform that pretends to be professional but they are yet another platform that charges high fees and in an instant can disable features so one is not able to withdraw crypto or even cash you have in your fiat wallet. Then their instant deposit is a scam as it took over two weeks to leave a pending state. A check takes less time to clear…this is supposedly a digital trading platform why would it take that long unless the platform is using one’s crypto or cash to their own benefit in addition to the fees. A total grift and scam in my experience.
crypto.com,ios,jajgmejcjnf,3,2021-12-10 22:31:35,Since august app has been great up until recently yesterday I can’t use or add my debit card on anymore. Called the bank everything was fine. Customer support was very vague and basically said I have to just wait and see if it works or try another payment option (that I don’t have) instead of trying to solve the issue. Very frustrating when you wanna buy stuff and customer support just says the same thing about being sorry for the inconvenience and to just wait. Not very happy with them and just want the issue resolved..

Processing time declared 3-5 business days. Today is day number five and I have not received my money. The explanation is system glitch. Who cares? The second request to withdraw funds rejected after four days of review. The lame reason- we have not processed the first request so it is over the limit 
One more thing the developers doing again and again. You are pushed to update the version of the app, but it is not yet working in Apple store. How difficult to ensure it is working prior to making update mandatory? Have not access to the app for more than 36 hours"
crypto.com,ios,Shiva_D,1,2021-05-15 22:33:31,"Takes 3 or 4 days to get any kind of response by chat. So if the app crashes while you are making a purchase they WILL CHARGE YOU ANYWAY, the 3 or 4 days later when you finally get some assistance, they will credit you at the price that day, so if you buy at 2.00 and the app crashes which it does ALL the time, when they finally credit you the coins if it’s at 6 or 8 or 10, then you have purchased those coins at that higher price even though you never would have bought them at that price.   Dealing with people’s money and a rapidly fluctuating market requires better than a 4 day turn around on customer support.  A coin might literally not exist 3 days later."

When you get ready to confirm your crypto purchase - it says “Fees = $0.” This is a lie. They have hidden fees. What they do is.. they markup the prices. For example, before you are ready to buy crypto there obviously are prices listed to buy crypto (the homepage). Then when you get ready to buy the crypto - they markup the price. They claim BTC is $24,500, but when you confirm your purchase they charge $24,800. A $300 MARKUP!! I’m starting to wonder if these positive reviews are bots. I’d stay clear of this platform."

The app seems to be a little buggy though and will randomly crash (especially when in the earn platform) Once the bugs are worked out of this version and possibly adding some more coins I would consider making this my main exchange app. One other area that could be improved on is the data. It only goes 6 months back and not great for research. There is no 52 week high and low etc. Hoping to see some future updates but overall this is a good app and trustworthy company.

I know it’s the app cause it won’t take any of my payments. Two cards that were accepting my form of payment stop working over all and now I can’t purchase at all. I tried signing out and clearing the page and nothing.
crypto.com,ios,Birplanckeb,1,2021-10-13 05:50:08,"Been using this app for about 9 months. This app leaves a lot to be desired. The graphs on it are basically useless. The price you see is not the price you buy/sell at, as it is always a few cents higher or lower, whichever direction you lose money. Also, doesn’t tell you your average purchase price in a coin. If I make multiple purchases in a coin, sometimes multiple in a day for different amounts, how am I supposed to calculate this effectively? THIS IS A BASIC FEATURE FOR ANY INVESTING APP. You gotta know your average in any security. Also, my bank charges an additional 3% to the 3% fee the app already charges for any money transfers. 6% is a lot trimmed off a 10% gain. Find a different app."

Cant log into website either without an error message and there is no option on the app for buy sell limits. I give up!

Even worse is I need a response from their team before I can liquidate causing me to not be able to sell at the highs and suffer through the lows.

I honestly found better apps and resources to invest. I searched alllllll through the app to try to remove my card and cancel but literally no option!

It takes about five minutes to upload info for verification. Unfortunately if they don’t like your ID, it will take days to close an account they won’t even open for you in the first place because they rejected your ID. 

When I got the ID issue (no state ID, only federal for USA) I requested them to remove my information that had been uploaded: self photo, ID, phone number, email and any other tracking information related to the account I couldn’t create. 

Via chat, a rep wouldn’t confirm deletion nor would they assist in closing it after asking me for verification of an account they wouldn’t open for me. I’m being told it was taken to the escalation team in order to close it.  

If an account can’t be opened, there should be no issue deleting PRIVATE AND PERSONAL information in their database. I’ll be contacting the state attorney’s office and inquiring into the legality of them refusing my request."

Its very easy to use, they have different tiered debit cards, the app is available to use in the USA, and from my own experience so far the customer service has been excellent. I wish I had something this convenient to use when I got started and I definitely recommend the app for newbies as well as seasoned crypto traders/investors."
crypto.com,ios,rjessieg,3,2024-05-14 00:02:08,"Absolutely love the idea, and the ease of use and crypto card. Poor execution overall.

Pros: 
• A lot of coins on a lot of networks
• Great incentives to earn, stake, and keep crypto
• Shiny metal cards that convert and earn cash back in Cronos Crypto
• Simple interface

Cons:
• Trades don’t feel accurate, and are always priced higher in buying and lower in selling than the live value
• Fees seem to be higher then most platforms
• No candlesticks
• Higher tier cards require lockup of large sums of Cronos crypto ($4k - $40k)
• To stake/lock up any other crypto than Cronos you need $3k-$4k worth of that crypto
• The costumer service is only in app
(no number to call and it’s mostly bots)

Overall, Good entry level wallet that definitely targets a younger demographic. Great for staking Cronos. However I would not use this as my main wallet or for any kind of serious trading or staking.

3 Stars because it works but it is the Wall Mart of Coin exchanges"

After a week and several thousands of dollars worth of transactions they blocked my account from making ANY transfers or buying items in their shop. My money is TRAPPED now and their response was “it’s a business decision” and if I have a problem with it I can read their terms.

crypto.com,ios,nogpo4u,1,2021-11-20 05:34:35,"If you are planning to invest more than $100 please do yourself a favor and pick a competitor broker. Here is the thing: they do show higher prices but ONLY if you buy. If you decide to sell your holdings for USD you’ll get a lower price than what you initially see the very last moment. If you buy, however, that higher price is what you’ll pay - and that makes their “first month no fees purchase” absolutely meaningless since the initial prices more than offset the potential fees. 
TL;DR - if you are planning on investing anything more than $100 this is the last broker you want to use. 

P.S. And please don’t fall for that Matt Damon commercial - this company is the classic bait-and-switch"

My purchase of $1400 quickly turned into 6k by the following day. 

When asking the very busy messaging/texting center (you can’t call anyone) they say the money will be refunded within 30 days... I got less than half the money back because the value of the coin had dropped so much by the time they refunded me. You tell them it’s a mess up on their end and they argue that it’s not.

This is literally a brand new phone from apple sealed.  I reached out to customer service and they said I need to restart the phone. Did that nothing. Then just stopped responding after nothing worked.. man...not only wasted my time but got all my information and identification, and blocked me out over some bogus “jailbroken phone” nonsense.   Crazy."

Tried to reach out to customer service but was told that high volume would put me in a queue for a few days. I have never had a response and the problem was never addressed and there is no help on the site to address this. So I converted my CRO to BTC and moved it into a better wallet. Oh, they don’t address your concerns and won’t let you follow up or create new requests. I gave two stars because you can by crypto and move it to another wallet. Other than that, I would stay away."

They are screaming the little guys and the ones with little experience in crypto. If you are new do not lock up your cro for staking rewards. I watched my account go from $30k to $3k because it took too long to unstake and sell. I really believed they would be the best platform in the USA. I believed in CRO coin. I don’t believe anymore after not having a real trading exchange be rolled out to USA users. No wonder coinbase is smacking you. Sad."

They also make you use a 6 digit pin to buy or top up, and give you a 15 second window to make purchases which is when you put in said pin, and the error message uses a majority of the time.

Shiba price is so inaccurate on this app. I feel like a lot of people going to be very upset. I wish most of my shiba wasn't staking I'd remove it from this app. Also how come on the staking the dates moving me closer to being unlocked seem to not move some days?

I wonder if this happens to others and when the price triggers up or down, what happens to my actual balance? Is it being accounted for? It's really shady and I don't like it.

After further reviewing, the really cool features require a stake in their crypto.... that’s fine. But most of the lower tiered cards have a slider to show benefits with or without a stake leading one to believe the card is obtainable without a stake. Even the site makes it appear that way. After speaking with support, it’s only an option without if you’ve maintained your stake for 6 months. A frustrating waste of time for me.

Now they’re holding up those transfers. If you want to burn your money or park it somewhere you don’t have access too, this is the app for you.

Only responses I’ve received were automated messages saying someone will respond shortly, but never hear anything back. 
Then to make me even more frustrated, a friend of mine decide to sign up last night and within 5 minutes her account was verified. Like really? 

The interface of the app looks nice and simple to use whenever I have seen my friends use it. If I am ever able to get verified and can actually use the app for myself, I would gladly come back and leave a positive review but as of right now ZERO stars from me. Customer Service is trash.

The only con to having this app is that if your bank/ credit union isn’t supported by the app…it is nearly impossible to withdraw your funds.

Here are a few hopefully this could be addressed soon:

1. Support feature allows u to chat with someone, but it will keep it on the chat screen and will tell you that it can be up to a day for a reply. Down side, when u close the message screen, the chat disappears. So if you need something resolved, until someone Answers, you cannot do anything else.

2. Your average cost position is not indicated.

3. Your original equity and profits are not shown either. 

4. Transfers using debit cards have been so buggy, it almost never works properly which is a shame considering i was hoping to take advatange of the 0% fee for debit card purchases for the first 30days but that doesnt work as it should. 

Hope these can be addressed in future updates!"

Very busy home page and it's not intuitive to find most critical information in the home page.
Look at the Robinhood to see how you should design the pages.
In home page the most important thing is showing all my coins with current price, my shares quantity and my profit/loss or each coin. The total profit/loss is already on top.

When I tap on an owned coin I should see all the transactions related to that coin

I should be able to re-order the list of watched coins.

I can't buy XRP however the buy button is there. If it's not tradable please remove the button 

In Crypto Wallet I should see list of owned coins not all coins. 

The notifications give me wrong alert. It says a coin if 20% down but when I look into the coin, its down but not 20%, it's down by 4%

The ""Account"" and ""Track"" navigation button on bottom of the page loos like unnecessary because the same information are in other pages.

I think the whole UI shod be redesigned."

I bought an UpDown Buy Order contract expecting for the price to rise, and when I pushed “Place Order”, the price was between $20 and $30, but they charged $82. I did lose at the trade because it reached the stop price, but like I told them, no save person would enter a contract with a loss potential of 4:1.

I signed up and literally wasn’t able to do anything so I guess no wins or losses to be had.

Customer service even reached out to me on their own initiative to explain why a withdrawal had failed, and using their advice, was able to succeed in what I was doing. (They don’t yet support Bech32 Segwit enabled wallets). 

Their low fees are unmatched everywhere I’ve looked so far and I will continue to use this service as long as that’s the case. 

Purchasing crypto is instant, and withdrawal to an external wallet usually takes about 24 hours. 

The security protection is helpful. A digit based password is required to open the app and every time a purchase or withdrawal is requested.

This platform seems to only cater to mobsters and whales who move large amounts of money. Do not fall into the trap of using crypto through this app, as the support takes days to provide a clear response and they tend to reply in the wee hours, knowing you won't be active to close the ticket. They then tell you to open another ticket. It's completely a rubbish platform."

My account was locked out without any reason and when you asked them why, they just sent you the terms and conditions saying they have the right to terminate your account without any reasons. They never want to talk to you personally, and all communication is fine through email. You can't connect to anyone on phone to find out what is going on. Apple needs to seriously investigate this platform before more people got scammed by them."

The company refuses to give me my money back I put $500 in there it’s funny how I can deposit money so easily but yeah every time I try to remove it to withdraw it it will not let me and I’ve been pleading for over 30 emails. But the company still just has a new person email me every time and they will let me withdraw the money it’s just sitting there on the app I can see it but the company refuses to give it back and I’ve already missed three payments now. I put it in just for the promotion and they wouldn’t give me that either so now I’m down even more.

And it has a great chart list for other cryptocurrency as well! But recently I have not been able to transfer cryptocurrency to other wallets and I am wondering when this will be fixed? It was available at one point, but I feel like the past two months something has changed."
crypto.com,ios,Austin Texas Bound,3,2021-12-05 03:02:04,So the funny thing is they will take your money from your bank and give you a hard complex time getting your money back when your ready to withdraw. Because they use plaid and some banks don’t accept 3rd party apps to convert your cash right over to you. Now I’m stuck with fiat cash for months sitting in a crypto account and haven’t been able to transfer to my bank . Let alone they will continue allowing me to deposit more . I feel helpless at this point and am just letting my frustration be known.
crypto.com,ios,jonportertmobileguy,1,2021-06-07 04:34:52,"The application holds several low priced crypto making it easy to buy the cheap ones, but if you don’t have at-least 100 dollars in the application you can’t withdraw your money.  Now that I want to close my application I have to download another app or add 85 dollars to make it 100. It’s absolutely a scam, not to mention how not user friendly it is. You have to add your card and bank several different times like it’s not connect, and convert money to “fiat” then to a crypto; during which you lose a small percent of money each time. Absolutely a waste of time. Not to mention terrible abysmal customer service."

By the time customer service gets back to you, it’ll be too late. You’ll already have hemorrhaged too much. 

Eventually my account disappeared along with all my money in spite of me having dozens upon dozens upon dozens of screenshots and emails (to the very email they said doesn’t have an account attached to it). So now I have to get litigious and press charges for theft/sue them to get my money back.

It’s very hard to find the app reliable when the customer service doesn’t bother to read my questions or try to help. It’s also unreliable when the website says they’ll send out tax forms by the end of January, and it is now a month later and i still have not received anything."

I like Public, I cannot see what my earnings are vs my Initial investments, percentage loss/gained, average price of investment, sense of investing community and broad access to multiple investment opinions. There is the “games(?)” section to explore and earn points…I don’t care about that.

But since using it for a few months consistently, the only reliable pattern I’ve recognized is that when the market is rallying and you stand to gain, transactions don’t go through, app freezes or lags til profits are gone. Losing money is the opposite, no problem with the app or transactions when things are bearish. Perhaps you’ll have better luck."

I sent in my request to actually get my account deleted and they responded a day later saying that they needed a new selfie image that showed my wrist, elbow and shoulder….. like how unprofessional is any of this.

The company suspended my card and told me I have to provide receipts from Walmart to unsuspend my account.  I don't  keep my receipts so this is impossible.  I told them I would just like to close my account and have my staked CRO returned to me. They are refusing to return the CRO that I PAID for. I've been going back and forth with customer service for weeks and they keep telling me to submit receipts even though I told them I don't have them.  I should not be required to keep receipts to use a prepaid debit card. I just want my CRO back so I can cash out and delete this app.

I’ve had to go through 6 different people requesting updates in my Visa card over 40 weeks and have still not received anything. They just keep telling me the same run around excuses and claiming they have escalated my case but I’m still waiting for them to get me my Visa card. This company won’t last long with this type of customer service. Never have they even asked if they could make up for all their mistakes which have postponed the arrival of my card beyond 40 weeks and counting. Avoid at all cost. Try voyager or Celsius

crypto.com,ios,enragedmonk,1,2024-06-05 01:12:12,"I have used this app for years! It has never been overly transparent with information. Let’s start with new coins. They list them on a regular basis. When you buy you pay full listed price or more if you don’t use limit buy. If there is a run on the coin, they label it low liquidity. You will only be paid a fraction of the listed price. I have had coins go up 100% in a matter of minutes. When you sell and expect to see your profit minus fees. Only to find out you lost 50% of your investment. So avoid anything that could be considered low liquidity. 

As I type this, CDC currently has Bitcoin priced 1.5% over actual value. There prices are wrong on every coin I have looked at. The only way to buy or sell at a predictable price is by using limit buys and sells. Unfortunately most of there coins don’t offer it. 

You can buy and hold on this app, but I certainly wouldn’t trade with it. The amount of your money they take is brutal!

Buyer and seller beware!!"

It makes me wonder, if I did have an account with them and an opportunity to take profits would I even be able to, or if I wanted to make a withdrawal would I be able to access my money.

crypto.com,ios,Hammertimez,5,2022-01-06 18:46:45,Out of all the exchanges for crypto this one takes the reign. It’s designed for easy understanding including a “university” where you can get points to earn free CRO and learn about crypto since less than 10% of the world is invested. This is still a great crypto and young to get involved in and then using it gets you instant cash back. I can’t tell you how much I love this. This review is not as good as it really is.
crypto.com,ios,TheOkJosh,2,2022-05-15 13:58:22,"For a company specializing in crypto, you’d think their app wouldn’t be buggy.

No matter how many times I agree and hit except, the box just keeps coming back; it’s an infinite Loop. I’ve tried restarting the app, uninstalling it and reinstalling it, no difference. I would’ve liked to have bought some crypto today but I guess I’m going to have to do it with a competing platform."
crypto.com,ios,Nickcryptoguy,4,2022-02-04 18:29:26,Overall a good app experience. But I think the interface could be better and easier to use for the casual user. They should copy Robinhood and Webull’s layout in a sense that the Home tab should have only my investment listed with a chart on the daily performance. As well as my average purchase price once I select a certain coin. I’d swap the accounts and track tabs. Also more clearly showing what currency you have staked.

I have sent a couple of emails to support and have yet not had a response. App states my phone number isn’t valid.  Only phone number I have and use for several years.  I would like at least a response and hopefully a fix since I still have money in my wallet and I do like the app when I could get in it.  It would at least be a 4 star if not 5 if I could use it.

Don’t understand why, I can use all other crypto apps here, I can honestly use literally any website/app no matter what. Besides theirs. Why? Also their prices are really bad because it’s not an exchange and you can’t set limit orders, and that’s probably not going to change. You lose a ton on the spread."

Now I had to deposit another $50 to be able to take my money out of this app because of the $100 minimum withdrawal limit. Glad it wasn’t $5,000 or $50,000. Always play around with an app with small amounts before you can trust them with anything serious. This app totally failed at gaining my trust. Stay away or you will lose every penny you have."

I was also able to actually email somebody back-and-forth with each of those.

crypto.com,ios,Trader Joe 7,1,2025-01-20 07:33:43,"I never realized it because they claim they have zero fees. However, you will lose between 12% to 20% when you purchase a crypto and an additional 12% to 20% when you sell that crypto.

I have run multiple test on it with various coins. If there is a Crypto that is one dollar and you have 1000 USDC, you should get 1000 of that crypto, if they have zero fees like they claim. But you won’t, you will receive 850 of that Crypto and then when you sell it back for USDC, you’ll be left with about 700.

So if you wanna make a profit on this platform, your Crypto needs to go up over 40% before you start counting your chickens."

It’s unusable and the website is unfortunately basically just an ad for the app. So I’ll have to stick with actual exchanges like Coinbase or KuCoin that can focus on having an interface for customers rather than buying stadiums and not having any security to prevent a $15,000,000 hack.

crypto.com,ios,St. Louis Rams fan,1,2021-05-15 04:43:36,Fees are ridiculous and well above 5% to sell crypto to cash.  I can’t even figure out the fees because it is randomly different for each crypto I want to sell. No other crypto exchange charges these kind of fees.  You also can’t do limit orders to set price for a buy or a sell like other top cryptos.  This way they tell you one price even though it isn’t exactly the market price and they keep the spread.  Since they are charging ridiculous fees there is no reason to charge for the spread too.  If you don’t have a lot to trade this is not the app for you.  Only use it if you like extremely high fees.

The only reason why I joined here is that they support more crypto than coinbase otherwise my goto will be coinbase. Please improve yourself."

Buttons confirming you want to withdraw funds won’t work, 2fa messages won’t send, and the app will lock randomly in the middle of entering wallet addresses. Once you finally get through the designed “mishaps” you will be told you now have to wait 24 hours to get your funds because the whitelist was updated too recently. Absolute joke. I fell for the bait and switch and staked my funds, patiently waited 6 months while they gutted every benefit and now still have to suffer this awful platform for another day or more."

Anyone you call will direct you to the chat which is a nightmare in its own. If they respond back to you and you don’t respond to them within 15 minutes, they close the chat so you’ll have to begin the process all over again. 

Even through email if you specifically ask them of something they will purposely redirect the conversation somewhere else. Most useless bots in the entire industry. 

Literally go to robinhood for crypto before you come to this app👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽"

Right at the end of my first big transaction the app just crashed and I was unsure if it went through for a while because it certainly deducted from my account immediately. And now I’m trying to set price alerts and once it gets the the screen where you punch in the values it does nothing at all and then crashes. I was really excited about this app but it’s been disappointing me from the start...these issues seem pretty easily fixable but I guess we’ll see..

When I did the first time, it says that my passcode doesn’t match. So I tried it again and it said the same thing. Now I tried it more than 30 times, turned off my phone to try it again and it still doesn’t work. What do I do? I’m going to give it a 3 star for now due to that issue which I hope will be fixed.

I've reached out to help and it takes days to respond and all I've received is basic steps to uninstall and reinstall, logout login, etc and nothing works. I can't even delete my account and try setup again because you can't delete your account. This has been one long buggy frustrating mess and I'm astonished that what appears to be one of the most popular apps for this sort of this is this poorly executed."

So basically my money is in limbo in this app and the customer service hasn’t replied in a few days. It’s been a few weeks since this happened and I just want my money back.  Without the fee that will end in a few days.  No phone number to speak, which is bad news.

Good trading app, bad customer service."

Look at other sources of true prices of products. Also, they take or display false account balance. If it says you have $1000 in a currency….when you try to withdraw it,  in any currency like USDC, ETH, USD, the REAL withdraw amount would be around $892. This platform takes mad money so beware. Charts and updates, even the real time is inaccurate. Look elsewhere is my advise, and it hurts sadly to say because this app use to be the best of them."

Fast withdrawals and deposits for the leading coins (may take longer for low cap alts they’ve recently added). The Visa card looks great and sounds great, can’t wait to try it out after the USA launch this summer. MCO token has crazy utility that will lead to it growing in value a lot when all cards are launched and the platform on boards more users. People sleep on this one."

Take a look at the fact that their 5 star reviews are all copy and pasted from the same message, and the recent news that they are conducting “internal investments” . (Which I’m sure they are doing incredibly morally like SVB)

They’ll respond and attempt to close the conversation in 24 hours unless you respond. Don’t attempt unless you plan to involve legal advice. 

If I could I would rate this at 0 stars. Worst investment ever. They don’t treat their customers as humans and refuse to explain the reasons why they can’t assist you. It’s straight garbage. 

Future investors are warned!!!"

crypto.com,ios,tashalee02,3,2021-05-18 00:41:26,I liked this service at first but then the dollar cost average would take days to update. This is very unethical. If you are trying to buy lower to bring your average cost down you are not able to sell anything until the average cost is correct. This is an unacceptable flaw and I am closing my account. The company may be doing this on purpose to make more $. Many may not notice they are selling at a higher average. Shame on you Voyager.
crypto.com,ios,Dan_theman_l,1,2021-10-24 16:37:46,I was experiencing a technical issue with the app itself and contacted support to try to resolve said issue. The chat feature in the app is finicky and frustrating to start. The result of me contacting customer support was them LOCKING MY ACCOUNT for a “random security clearance”. After that I had to jump through a series of hoops to be re-verified in order to access MY MONEY. Im still currently working this out after 14 hours of nonsense. The support team can take anywhere from seconds to HOURS to respond to a chat you just sent with no communication on what’s happening. I will never use this app again.

But then a few months past by and i was able to log in but the surprise was that it said i had no money, so now they been wasting my time for like two weeks asking me to do all kind of nonsense, transferring me to a new department whos going to fix my problem every day and still no money"
crypto.com,ios,Fijillian,5,2022-10-03 18:43:52,This app has worked well as an alternative to Coinbase. The onboarding process can be lengthy and if you move it can also be tedious getting the proper documents to update your location etc. Other than that the app makes purchasing crypto easy and lets you transfer them to external wallets you control the keys to as well as dapps so you can participate in DEXs etc.

Selling to stable coins has big fees, switching from token to token has even bigger fees. They really get you there. If you’re new all you’re going to do on here is loose money.

They make it difficult to withdrawal your crypto off the app and have a stupid white list address for 24 hrs before you can withdrawl. There’s already 3 other security protocols. I’m convinced this is to get you to keep your stuff on there.

Over the past month, I’ve had 8 deposits of crypto that took up to 12-24 hours to credit to the proper wallet. I can send out in seconds but receiving takes hours. This is a huge problem, if you intend on depositing to make a calculated move. By the time support contacts you back, which can take up to 3 days, they laugh and ask if it’s still a problem. They know it’s not but the giggles and laughter are an insult. Than they say to contact us, “when it does happen again.” Fortune does not favor the bold and glitched."

You have to jump all over the place to buy and go see your previous bought cryptocurrency. Then there’s cashing out. You have to transfer it to another wallet, not your bank account. It won’t let you. So all the money you made is useless unless you learn a second way to get your money out. And it’s not easy learning how to do it through the app, as stated above how bad it is for new users. It’s shouldn’t be this hard to operate on the app. Use Coinbase.

This is all very suspicious. Do not use this app. Do not support them. Be wary. They are unwilling to work with me even thought it appears to be a problem on their end. The fact that they don’t have an in app means of deleting your account is suspicious already. I would not recommend anyone use this app ever."

You can never transfer out the full amount of crypto you own. Ex. I transferred exactly 51 DOT with a .10 fee, they only transferred most of it & took their fee & purposely left a small amount remaining that was supposed to transfer.  Since they require minimal amounts in order to  transfer you are forced to buy more from their app or convert small amounts to their worthless proprietary coin.  But you can NEVER transfer out all of your assets creating a cycle to defraud you in small amounts.  ITS A SCAM and’s should be illegal.  Use another exchange that is more ethical."

I’m all for updating the app, but there is no reason why access to the app should be prevented for minor updates. Just annoying having to update almost every time I open the app. This will steer people away. To be honest, I would likely use a different service if one existed, just to avoid this."
crypto.com,ios,Lady being scammed,1,2024-03-29 02:18:00,I got this app in hopes to start investing in bitcoin. This app was referred to me by someone I thought was my friend. Once I found out about my account being taken over I contacted support which has no urgency whatsoever to help retrieve funds. There is only message support and it is out of the realm of automated support which you then wait two or more days while someone has stolen your funds. Absolutely horrible customer service which in turn makes you feel as if they are in on the fraud / scam. If giving zero stars was an option that is what I would give.
crypto.com,ios,Rob12286,1,2023-01-22 12:29:09,Money goes in smooth. Good luck getting your money out. You have to go through fire hoops and spiked bounds to make a simple transfer to an outside wallet. Ridiculous little errors in the app and a 24 hour wait time that has not turned into a 2 week wait. Customer service is a joke. Copy paste closest answer to customers problems. Doesn’t fix the problem it’s just preset response from an employee that clearly hasn’t done real life training for any meaningful time. Normal Wall Street crooks taking advantage of what regulations are in place. A typical modernized Wild West story of stealing hard working folks money.

Want to transfer to another wallet, nope not easy, it isn’t fluid or make sense to how any human on the planet thinks!  

Want to take your shib and trade or use it to arm, nope you have to go through cro and even then that process has hidden fees and is very complex to use! 

Basically this app was created by someone that didn’t want to create an easy to use and efficient and friendly app!  

There is also no clear exit ability, once they have your money it’s like having to navigate a hallway of help trying to get it out and use it unless you have their card, they made that hard but not impossible! 

It has potential, allot of information but for this level of incompetent design I compare to trying to make eggs for breakfast but you have to go to the store first and you live an hour from the nearest market!"

I was also charged $56 to transfer $100 to another wallet and was told by support I should of read the fee page in the application before sending. Normal network fees are $.35 which i still had to pay. This is a money hungry exchange. User Beware. I thought Coinbase was bad until I used this app. Unfortunately going back to Coinbase.

I can’t do anything on the app without them showing me a pop up about something I don’t care about. It’s annoying. You want to check a price? Well, here’s a pop up with no obvious x to close it. You have to click it and go to their page they want you to look at. Then you can go do whatever. I just want to see how my coins or tokens are doing."

The average rating based on the past 100 reviews is down to approx 1.5 stars. That’s pathetic for a company whose customers are trusting them with their hard earned money. 

Their generic response to every unhappy customer is “we would like to look into your issues, please reach out to us via the crypto app or email us at contact@crypto…”

Just 2 million gone out of thin air. Customer service told me to send in a picture with my face and words on a paper. That was this past Friday and i haven’t heard a word back. And what i find funny was that I wasn’t even able to sign in the entire day because it kept tell me my passcode was wrong when I use Face Id to sign in. So after all of that I’m missing money, still have lent heard anything and feel like this app do not care at all. Go somewhere else"

I normally don't have a problem withdrawing as it usually shows up the next day but this is very unprofessional. Then there is was a duplicate charge in my bank account for when I deposited money into my crypto last week which I disputed with my bank. It's like you guys are stealing my money

That’s where I have to give this company credit..they are actively adding new crypto’s to their app, they are actively working on getting the USA on board..thank you!!

When I finally do after being informed that my information was corrected. I’m locked out again. So clearly it wasn’t.

To make matters worse the App is junk I can’t even see what’s in my wallet or how many coins of each currency I have its just blank.

However, when I set up my fiat wallet I got a pending message, and then it turned into a ""failed"" for USD. I also got a fail for setting up my address and SSN.

Usually when a developer responds to the complaints in the review section I see it as great sign that they care about the app and want to improve it.

Their spreads are way more than all of the other platforms too. The site says instant bank transfers are available to trade immediately. Again, ONLY FOR MARKET ORDERS.

I would’ve never used this app if I knew they were a bunch of scammers. Stay away or they will steal from you when you need it most"
crypto.com,ios,CryptoRicFlair,5,2021-11-22 16:39:22,I love the app Ovr but half the time it don’t even load and allow you to log in! Steady blue screen! Also the refer and sign up bonuses are a joke and super hard to actually collect! I’ve referred 10 ppl and can’t access none the bonus until the ppl who I referred stale and upgrade card and that is just trash have these coins in ya portfolio and can’t even have em!

Recently, somebody has transferred all my cryptos to unknown number and their customer service is so bad that they didnt help me at all for that unauthorized transaction I lost my hundreds of dollars. They keep blaming me that when i bought cryptos from this app i agreed to the policie and we can not do anything. Its very easy just to say like that without helping customers. Please Please do not use this app for buying cryptos, use any other app but not this one."
crypto.com,ios,mrsahndly,1,2021-06-16 14:47:35,"I switch to this platform because it was recommended by a friend. Now my moneys stuck.
I like to keep my money in crypto like a wallet, only pull if I need some, well this app will not let you pull any money out unless it’s 100$ or more. Okay, so I go to transfer my crypto back to my other crypto wallet, they say they’re sending me an email confirmation first, never did. Yes the email is right, yes I checked junk folder. Okay, whatever, so then I just go to transfer the min 100 and it says my withdraw is under “review” like what in the world no just give me my money I want it out of this app now!"
crypto.com,ios,do djdhcjfheusjd,1,2021-05-25 21:13:57,"When you first create your account, the app tells you that you get your first 30 days free of transaction fees.  Because of this, I made several purchases within the first 30 days.  As I was making the purchases, the app showed it was charging 0.00% in fees.  I later checked my bank account and found that this was not at all the case.  They charged me 3% per transaction. I contacted support to get this sorted out and they basically told me there was nothing they could do as my 30 days had expired.  

Do not use this crypto broker!  And if you decide to, take screenshots of EVERY transaction."
crypto.com,ios,cmoneyrecords,1,2021-05-25 18:36:33,"This app made it look easy to begin trading. It then asked me for most of my personal information, and even required a picture of my drivers license. As soon as I upload the picture, it says “it’s not available in my region”. I can’t understand why it would let me proceed just to say I’m not allowed to trade. Not to mention, I’m in New York, how is it not available here? 

As my rant comes to an end, I am very disappointed with this app and feel as if they just stole my personal info in order to sell it to the infamous  “car extended warranty” spam call. 

I wish I could rate this 0 out of 5."
crypto.com,ios,tinobambino26,1,2021-05-24 14:44:55,"I think by far the worst app for crypto i have been trying to setup my fiat wallet for months , it took four weeks for the first verification to get denied, I sent them a bill which was required and the second time I got denied. There isn’t a support number to call, everything is through chat and through chat they say that somebody will reach you in a day which doesn’t happen. It seems like very shady business practice. They can take you money through a credit card but makes it hard to setup money to withdraw from a fiat account. It’s not right at all"

Finally got an email back that basically pointed to me to FAQ section, that does no good what so ever because the problem is in the system and so call verification process.  If they cant figure out how to get there system to work for their verification process, then why would you trust them with anything else.  Run the other way, and run fast!!!!"
crypto.com,ios,Crypto.com fix ur app,1,2021-05-08 06:27:02,Everything is fine until you want to sell. When you sell it doesn’t go straight into your wallet you have to buy shares in another Crypto. And if you haven’t got approved for fiat wallet you have to leave it in what ever crypto you put it in. And that’s very bad design because it could go down. I’ve lost over $100 because of it and I didn’t really put that much in but it’s still lost money for no reason. I feel bad for the people who have put thousands in because they can easily lose a lot of money from it. So if you don’t want to lose money don’t use this app.

Tidwell,1,2021-10-27 17:38:20,I updated the app and was not able to log back in you would think when you contact customer support about not being able to log into the app especially when you have money invested into it… that you would get a quick response but that definitely has not been the case. I usually love this app and have no problems but this situation makes me very uneasy. How can yo invest your money somewhere and not have any other way to access it and poor response times from customer service to fix issues very disappointing.

For example say something is worth $1.50 per share when you go to sell it it might actually sell for $1.40. Essentially it’s a Hidden fee and I have gone around and around trying to get them to refund it but I think because they’re based out of the country that they screwed the rules and have no way of being held accountable other than being kicked from the Apple store which I think is necessary considering what they’re doing, stealing!"

You will need to read through pages of information to find out all of the fees involved. I staked 400$ of crypto in order to earn the 25$ CRO bonus and was denied it because I unstaked it before requesting the reward. Even tho it shows I staked the required amount. The customer service is difficult if impossible to reach by phone and you get an unhelpful chat bot when you contact it for help. When there are many choices for your crypto? Avoid this one at all costs

Also I noticed that the price is off in their favor so when you buy you can never know what price you will get. And the prices are also not shown clearly so it’s hard to tell.
It is very shady.

I tried closing my account to get away from this horrible app by sending all my coins to a friend and I get the same “insufficient balance”.

crypto.com,ios,Tax_Master,1,2022-05-31 17:27:26,It is very apparent that the creators are Liberal/Democrat. With this new Event section of the application you can see that they are using only the colors blue and red. Red identifying a “Risk” and blue identifying “Safe”. These are just small ways one tries to persuade an audience with ones own opinion. There are a million other color combinations that could have been used but its very clear that there a motive behind this. Transferring all shares out of the platform and to Computer Share.

However, this app functions so poorly that I’ve only been able to successfully purchase one of them. I constantly get “an error occurred” and I know for a fact that it’s not a problem with my bank.

I have one debit card that lets me purchase with my bitcoin and converts them to dollars that are needed for my purchase so I don’t lose money when bitcoin goes up because my bitcoin stays bitcoin until I spend them

Although the platform failed to withdraw funds to pay for crypto, it was successful in debiting a $.10 charge so clearly saved my account information and was able to draft from account. Also took over three hours to close my account. Tried through the app, through url, through support via rep and sent email. Terrible app and terrible experience from start to finish. I reached out to support team who was unable to help."
crypto.com,ios,Tabrego22,1,2024-12-15 21:52:05,So I got the card and needed to send money to someone but can’t because they don’t allow that through Apple Pay but you can add the card to Apple Pay??? Doesn’t make too much sense!! When I called customer service they were telling me all these restrictions and if it’s my money why can’t I do what I want with it?? They made me feel as if the assets weren’t completely mine. They don’t even get all the coins first they get their cryptos way after other apps so idk how long I’m going to stay with them ima go back to Robin Hood!!

There’s literally “no one home” at this company. No 1-800 number to call. Their chat is just all bots. No one responds back from email inquiries. It’s a false front.

They changed everything you like about this app. As soon as you get established and start using something or liking features they change them and or charge you. For instance, I traded when this first opened and you could take money off as you needed as low as 20$. Now you can’t take money unless it’s over $100. That’s just one small example. Visa cards are pointless, the perks went away for the regular average joes.. you don’t get the $25 unless you stake $500.. you don’t get cash back anymore.. list goes on folks"

It kept telling me fiat feature missing and every time I would link my accounts over and over again, nothing happened. I even reached out to the support team multiple times, no response or a number to actually call and speak to someone. It's very frustrating, so I just deleted the app because it shouldn't take all of that. Maybe they'll improve on this, I don't know..."

I’ve gotten a new phone number and I’m not able to change it to my new one so that I can verify to login! I’ve verified my email cause it’s the same. Talking to there customer service via chat is terrible, it’s like I’m talking to a A.I with no real answers to my issue that I’m having! And then emailing them it like the same thing, they keep responding late and apologize for late response but never resolve the issue at hand! This is ridiculous!"
crypto.com,ios,Supermain7,1,2024-03-13 15:34:33,"They have extremely high fees when you buy and sell.  Even to transfer fees are very high.  I place a limit order and even though it goes above, It does not hit (ex. If you set the limit order at $1 and even though certain crypto goes way past that $ amount,  it will not execute until it abreast 10%+)  which makes fees like 10% or higher even though it's limit order).  They take good chunk of your profits.  I thought robinhood was expensive but this is highway robbery.  I will be moving out of this exchange for sure."

I have had to update my app probably 150 times for bug fixes etc. also, if you don’t use your card that you have to stake your money to get, YOU GET CHARGED. Pretty ridiculous really. Company way looking good out of the gate but at this point I’m about to transfer all assets to another platform."

I went to go deposit additional funds using the instant ach method and they disabled it. Required me to spend $25 fee on a wire fee to the company and required me to do a $1,000 minimum wire. Total scam to make their balance sheet on their books look good. Will be speaking with a lawyer about this."

crypto.com,ios,treyhm,1,2022-02-02 18:08:19,Has the intentions of a scam artist. This app could not be more difficult to use. It’s funny you can deposit thousands of dollars within seconds and have no problem. But WITHDRAWING money is virtually impossible. After a week I finally added a fiat wallet and now they I need to have $100 minimum. So send a $100 to get the rest of my money? Sounds like a scam. I will never use this app again. I can name 100’s of apps that will allow you to get your money just as easy as you sent it. They want to keep your money. Stay far far away.

Waiting 24 hours to have to send ADA to a wallet can cause people to miss out on NFT drops. The way the market moves is very fast and 24 hours is way too long to wait for something like this. Once I’m able to send my crypto to a different wallet I will be leaving this platform so that I can actually do faster transactions. I hope this changes in the future. Also customer support is almost nonexistent and not user friendly."

They take you to the cleaners with hidden fees.  I had some Bitcoin to sell today. The market price was $85,048, which was the price if you were buying. However the price if you were selling was $83,452. Really CDC?  A $1500 knock to sell. No fees was the biggest lie this company ever advertised. They just hide the fees from the average user. Moving to Kraken."

Literally because visa makes them. 

Went through support on the app and their employee was literally screwing with me and made me upload my ID 3 times to continue to tell me I needed to keep uploading my ID to update “different things” in their system. 

Eventually he admitted he thought my ID expired in 2023 (when it was issued and it expired in 2031). 

So he made me sit there and upload my ID 3 times and wouldn’t say it was because he thought it was expired. 

Honestly the worst customer service experience in my entire life. 

The customer service on the phone was made aware- and they didn’t care, they said they were only for Visa cards and hopefully next time I get a better employee. 

Honestly I only still have this app so I can stake CRO

Other than that, go to Coinbase!!"

Account is locked till you do them so if you are trying to sell this is problematic. Iv updated it twice within the last 7 dates. you guys definitely need to make your app run even if you don’t have the newest update so that people can still access their accounts that have their own finances in. I shouldn’t have to update your app every 3 to 5 days that is absurd.

I’ve looked on Twitter now X and numerous people have the same issues. I’ve called and nobody ever answers and then it goes to voicemail and you can’t even leave a message because it automatically hangs up on you haha this is so frustrating and annoying. I never had any problems for the last couple years until just 2 weeks ago!

Try to use my ATM card to buy crypto worked for a year then it started to get declined switched to a credit card it gets declined. Just not a smooth experience for me compared to the other platforms that I use ( ie: RH, CB ) and not having an actual number to call for help is terrible and frustrating."
crypto.com,ios,zombinomore,5,2023-02-06 02:53:23,It’s the most ridiculously biased platform ever.  I should off known from when they took Lebrun money.  They sale you at highest price. And buy it from you at lowest price. They let you do limit sell or buy orders when ever is good for them. It’s ridiculous.
crypto.com,ios,JESUS@33lives,3,2023-07-06 18:03:53,I’m giving 3 stars because I hate the fact that the app doesn’t automatically update the price. Every time I look at the app I have to drag it down to get the app to update the price when it should do it automatically. Even when I make a transaction It doesn’t reflect the price automatically. And yes my app is updated. Please Fix this then the app would deserve a 5 star rating.
crypto.com,ios,Justianpohoski,5,2022-12-26 23:55:55,Best navigation app in the world but if you could get the other order features and AI if it doesn’t have it to be able to use bots on would make it way more popular. Also best bid prices to market prices and more than just target orders as well will draw attention.

Then the customer support is so bad they won’t ever reply and will keep repeating your question back to you. This app is a joke and I hope everyone stays away from it. Never again will I use this.

All in all this app does not compare to 70% of the other exchanges. DO NOT USE THIS APP - YOU WILL LOSE MONEY EVERY TRADE. CHECK YOUR TRANSACTION NEXT TIME YOU SELL, the $ that ends up in your wallet is always less."

FFS give us notice before forcing updates. Don't lock us out of the app. It's so frustrating. Why does a 45Mb update need > 2Gb of storage space to update? 3. Hidden staking fees. They take 25% of your earnings. It's virtually impossible to find this info on their app. Use Nexo or Exodus instead. 4. Upgrading tiers is pointless. No benefits at all.

Sometimes to see the card balance one needs to exit the app and enter again. The customer service rather than help sometimes they create the problems. WARNING: hidden fees, for example, they say that withdrawals only charge you for the network fee; but analysing the tx on an explorer is easy to see that the real network fee was an order of magnitude smaller than the applied fee."

Update - Do not use this app at all. No transaction history, no fee history, many hidden fees."

You have to enter a 6 digit PIN which wouldn't be a big deal, but every time you put the app in the background it makes you enter it again. Still not a huge deal, but then it interrupts you with ads while you're entering the PIN. Plus you have to download an authenticator app to use as well. It's probably very safe because of these things, but other apps don't need these annoyances and I've not had any issues yet."

crypto.com,android,Visa Trade (VisaTrade),5,2025-03-15 21:55:43,"I have been using for over 4 years. The buy/sell prices seem scammy due to a lack of transparancy but when directly compared with other exchanges the result is more for less on the buys and less for more on the sells. I wish they would spend more on customer support though. Unless you've staked for a Ruby Steel or higher, they try to give you the runaround to get you to go away. Usually new investors will not lockup money with your app unless you give them the benefit of the doubt in support."

But the reason why I couldn't give them that .5 and giving them a full 5 star? They lack experience talking to their customers. Didn't answer me correctly 😔

But there are tips for beginners and more video tutorials to make it easier to understand and get used to the interface. I recently discovered a cool feature like launchpads, I advise all beginners to use it. I really like that, first of all, reliable coins are shown on the market, and then with risk. Online support always responds and explains what and how to do, as well as a pleasant and simple interface disposes to trust and calms the nerves that are a little tense during trading.

 I like navigation. It is easy and understandable to understand the application. In fact, from the first minutes you understand what and how to do. I advise you to start using launchpads and staking, because these are low-risk methods to earn your first money in the crypt.

Bybit doesn’t have any good feature for verified advertiser because the none advertiser can always go higher by spoiling the rate 

Why not hide the none verified advertiser the way binance did unless a customer filter them in why do you have to filter verified advertiser in instead of filtering not verified this is putting verified advertiser into frustration please see to this I pray this review reach the team and they take responsibility thank you for you little good work"

One of the things I appreciate most about this exchange is the security measures they have in place. They use two-factor authentication and keep the majority of their funds in cold storage, which gives me peace of mind knowing my assets are safe. Additionally, the customer support team is incredibly responsive and helpful, which is important in the world of cryptocurrency where things can move quickly.

Another standout feature of this exchange is the variety of cryptocurrencies available for trading. They offer a wide range of coins, including some of the lesser-known ones, which makes it easy to diversify my portfolio. And the fees are very reasonable, which is always a plus.

bybit,ios,MolinaLukebakio🌎,5,2024-09-27 09:09:10,"This app is such a great cryptocurrency app that is very easy to use and convenient to keep digital assets. It takes patience and a lot more calculations or predictions to be able to achieve all l've gotten through crypto but strategizing when to buy, hold and sell my crypto put me on the edge. If you're not consistent with daily tracking of crypto price fluctuations, you might find it difficult to gain excessively but I came across a trustworthy crypto and IT expert through a very close friend who got their services from her in recovering her lost bitcoins and learned that they can recover compromised or lost crypto wallet. I would recommend the services of Cryptoshades@ yahoo to help you invest or recover your stolen or lost coins successfully as quick as possible."

This app is definitely on par or better than most of them out there. I have been using it for about 2 years now and I may only trade here and there but its nice to come back to a simple interface with easy browsing to do exactly what your looking for. Now that they have Defi Mining and Cloud Mining it makes it even better and another way to diversify my portfolio and become more profitable is something I am always looking to do. Theres nothing complicated here and thats what keeps me trading here.

bybit,ios,braveonyema,1,2024-04-03 13:47:18,"I want to believe that there are people paid to write good reviews about this app and how much are they paid? 
This is the most unprofessional market place I have ever seen in my entire experiences on any crypto app. How can someone believe that I paid for a token on the p2p section and after 5 minutes of clicking confirmation button the seller appealed for not receiving his money and the token was reversed to him in 3 minutes time without asking for the proofs of payment, I was able to dispute the appeal immediately and the seller’s token was locked up, in few minutes time, the seller got his money and notified them that he has received the money but my token is being locked up since then without any response from the customer service. I also have other ones which the sellers have authorized Bybit to release token to me but they just held all till date."

Everything is stranger and Bybit IDO and airdrops let me learn in easy ways. After I realized USDT pool and others, I really enjoyed it all (but sometimes, later it allows the less-valued new crypto pool) Else, I love it , including MNT staking is also my favorite. When I transfer, Mantle network to Mantle network is No- Gas - Fees ( web3 <-> cex) Only I want to suggest is to improve more about CS customer service because it’s a little more longer than other famous cex, thinking that Bybit will be more and more popular and it needs more good service. Hope it improves in a speedy momentum ❤️"

To my surprise Bybit allowed this merchant to keep on taking orders , and still this moment my coin has not been released . Their live support only read my message . No feed back no support .Cause I really don’t know how I will provide evidence and your merchant would not produce one and I’d have to be the one to suffer for this . I lost my supplier because of this transaction, I haven’t been able to pay him for his coin because you refused to let go of the coin . This is a disgrace. It’s hurtful and a shame on your side , me choosing to trade with you shouldn’t mean I should have to suffer this much. Most painful thing is you allowed your merchant to keep on trading while I suffer for being a victim of scam move and a bad management system"
bybit,ios,ariana grace walker,5,2021-07-31 18:30:53,"Bybit is a long time favorite for me when leverage trading the basics like BTC, ETH, EOS, & XRP. The simplicity of the platform is what makes it so appealing to me. The Leverage is good too and maxes at 25, 50, & 100x.  The drag and drop feature for orders and stop loss is one of my very favorite features too, more exchanges should use that in my opinion. The only reason i give ByBit a 9.5 instead of a 10 is because they could definitely need to offer more trading pairs. I have always thought if you had ByBit's interface with KuCoin's variety you'd have a homerun Crypto Exchange on your hands. Thanks for all the hard work you guys have put in ByBit Team!"
bybit,ios,PqraNoiia,1,2024-08-03 07:11:48,"This app's 5 star reviews are fake. This entire app is a SCAM, PLEASE read all the bad reviews. I just downloaded the app but I immediately read the reviews BEFORE opening the app. Every bad review on here is basically telling proof as to how this app is a HUGE SCAM. Glad I dodged this bullet. Do NOT download ByBit. I even read some of their ""Developer Responses"" to some of the reviews.

One guy mentioned how they changed the name of his BVN, and the developer response was literally a copy and paste of the rest of their replies.
The developer responded ""We apologize for the delay"" delay in what? Delay in Nothing, they're so used to the 1 star reviews calling them out for being scammers that they're not even reading the reviews anymore. Just copying and pasting ""sorry for the delay"" because everyone on here is NOT receiving their money once they try to WITHDRAW their own money."

When you are in massive profit and you want to sell at market order , it's not able to execute . I made 11% gains on Ecox/USdt pair and when I wanted to close th order in profit I wasn't allowed by the system but when the profit fell to just about 1% and I placed the order it executed . This app can't be trusted . Binance is the only smooth and trusted trading app per my 5 years experience .  I only wanted to give Bybit a shot when CZ resigned but they are not worth it . Not at all in my case . This isn't the first . I previously had a trade before th ecox and when it reached my target , the system didn't execute the trade in profit . Either their system lags or they do that intentionally . Or probably low liquidity which raises eyebrows . Becareful with this app don't put any big money there ."
bybit,ios,Purple8_,5,2023-12-28 05:14:46,The Bybit app has been useful ever since I started using it. As an mediocre trader I have found the app to be so helpful for me. I discovered copy trading aswell as other good options that help making trading less stressful. There are many opportunities and you’re also able to use the Bybit card which was delivered in less than a week for me. By spending coins or other assets you’re able to collect points and redeeem them for voucher codes for daily use. Overall I rate the app a 10/10 and I’d suggest it to anyone looking for a great user experience.
bybit,ios,Jackson D44,1,2023-09-20 09:49:38,"In all honesty, I would give no stars! They are unquestionably the worst money app available. They keep closing my accounts for no apparent reason, therefore I had two accounts with them. They won't respond to my questions. They took money from me and won't give it back. They rank among the largest frauds in existence. The poorest customer service can be found there. Everyone there is from somewhere else. If you try to get answers from them, they will hang up on you and speak terrible English. They assert that my case was escalated, however it was never. They never emailed me in the first place, but I received an email saying that my case was closed because it had been open for more than three days. After making a report to ABERDEENDYCELP my hard earn money came back to me."

bybit,ios,Jonperk318,1,2021-01-09 05:26:53,"For my fellow inexperienced traders, please DO NOT USE THIS. I thought it would be easy, but it’s the most horrible, stressful, money-wasting experience I’ve ever had. 

We’re in a bull market, and so I thought it would be easy, but I kept getting wrecked until I had nothing left. $6,000 gone simply because I was deceived into thinking this would be easy. I didn’t fully understand how everything worked, where to set the stop losses, the hidden fees... etc.

Maybe you’re a pro, and that won’t happen to you, but chances are, you’re just not as good as you think you are. You’re too confident in the skills you think you have. The truth is, most people lose, the poor get poorer, and the rich get richer. This profit is mainly going to the rich in this game, so stay out at all costs. You’ll have better luck with the lottery (which I also do not recommend).

Go live a happy life, free from the cares of the miserable trap of leverage trading some of the most volatile assets in the world. You have a better purpose in life than to be enslaved to this greedy game. You were made to know God through his son Jesus Christ. He deserves your life - not this."

bybit,ios,graytradinglab,2,2024-11-28 00:37:20,"It is a well made app for trading but there is a major misleading liquidation price information.

The gap between the estimated liquidation price that shows up in the main trading page and and the TP/SL page (stop-loss trigger by ROI %) are very different.

For example, if the estimated liquidation price shows up in the mainpage is $50,000 and you type the same $50,000 in the stop-loss trigger by ROI(%) section, you will be seeing -50% (not -100%). The estimated liquidation price that shows up in the main page is correct. So don’t think that you will only be losing -50% per your stop-loss setup, instead you will be liquidated."

bybit,ios,Xcode231-,1,2025-03-18 11:12:16,"Bybit should improve its P2P trading process. When a dispute is filed, the buyer is given the ability to refresh and manipulate the process, which causes delays and issues. In this case, the buyer marked the payment as ""paid"" when they had not actually made the payment. After the seller files a dispute and provides proof that no payment was received, the investigation process is delayed significantly. This is compounded by the buyer being allowed to refresh the dispute timeline, which should not be the case.

Please consider improving the P2P trading system, as many of us need access to our funds urgently. The current process wastes valuable time and causes unnecessary stress."

bybit,ios,IP Knight Ninja,4,2021-06-03 17:44:40,Funding rate and fees should be added in positions open and or when closing a position it should show what fees customer is on the hook for as it can be changing fluidly and especially for beginners!. I do like all the work the team at ByBit has put into the trading experience as I am using ByBit more frequently. I still like BitMex and Binance for all the different trading pairs they offer. I hope ByBit will offer more in the future but dependability is most important. Thanks for all you do ByBit team and keep up the great work:)
bybit,ios,EdubOlando,5,2021-07-15 06:54:08,"I love learning how to trade on By it. First there is a test site where you can learn and once you are confident, and making good sensible trades, you can switch to real trading! So awesome. Also Bybit always has a new fun reward each month or task to do to gain money! This app is awesome you even get paid to set up your trade as a limit trade instead of market!

The horizontal orientation doesn’t give the same feel at all. edit: Also want to add that the 1m and 1M show the same minute chart, instead of the 1M showing the month. Once the vertical ability to chart is back, mixed with this being corrected, I think I’ll use the app a lot more.

All this just happened within 48 hours now.
Note: I won't give a positive feedback if my funds are not release. And if I do not come back here with a positive feedback just know they didn't release my coin and it's a big scam and a verified way to extort money from you. Thanks"
bybit,ios,Hayzed💰🥶,2,2024-11-18 19:17:43,Bybit is needs to upgrade they’re platform in terms of P2P trading. Some are are not worth to be selling on Bybit some buyers will open trade not like they are ready to buy but they will only waste your time since they know that selling doesn’t have ability to cancel the order. They won’t cancel the order so seller can trade with another buyer and they will just waste the whole time. I hope they should work on this very thing they should allow seller to be able to cancel the order if he/she se that the buyer is not serious. Thanks

1. notification options—we should be able to choose what kind of notifications we receive, and most importantly, where they are sent to (text vs email).
2. Reverse button. There should be a reverse button on the derivatives trading page. Other exchanges have this and it’s a helpful feature.
3. Alert notes.  When setting alerts for coins, we should be able to enter notes on those alerts, so that when the alert is triggered we receive a message that reminds us of why we set the alert in the first place.

The above 3 features would make this a 5-star app."
bybit,ios,I'm a Swimmer,5,2024-11-22 08:51:27,"Congrats Bybit team! 🎉 As a long-time user, I just want to say thanks for the awesome platform and your work! Your P2P market is top-notch, and I love the variety of trading options available. Keep up the great work! 🚀 minor improvements: to add more filters for ad listings (such as filter by someone with whom I already traded). Also I’d love to see the BTC option market grow."
bybit,ios,psydock1,5,2024-08-18 14:10:17,"Bybit is the most suitable exchange for users of all ranges I’m impress how easy is to buy crypto with debit or credit card or even using third party services like P2P. 

 It’s increíble how with 2 taps you can buy or sell a huge variety of crypto assets, or invest in defi products, even you can access to potencial launchpool projects from the app.

 When it comes to savvy user services, like trading derivatives perpetual swaps, Bybit offers you an educational material and a easy to use interface to monitor your positions, risk levels and oversight markets.

 We can also switch from web3 to exchange thanks to thee integration with the Bybit wallet to ease the log in with dapps. Keep building ! 😀 I love it"
bybit,ios,ShmurdaHG,3,2024-11-15 08:21:07,"This app has a great potential and durability but I think it can be improved by introducing its own crypto card option we can use to carry out online transactions, also I think we should be allowed to do more on the app like blogging or playing mini games to earn crypto rewards. Importantly I think the P2P option should be more efficient thereby filtering and punishing the scammers ruining the experience. I hope this improvements are considered and implemented."

A vendor was trying to scam me he said he didn’t receive the payment and I made the payment and he sent and appeal I defended my self on the appeal by showing more proof but the vendor couldn’t show his proof and Bybit told him to refund and cancel the appeal but the order is still on I was also telling the vendor to release crypto or refund but he disagree and Bybit didn’t do anything on that and he appealed me again and I defended myself again and Bybit is not saying anything and it’s been 2 weeks now 
I don’t know what to do"
bybit,ios,Michael419_,1,2025-02-23 22:12:35,"This is the most scam crypto app I’ve ever seen too much fees to convert and when you receive coin they won’t let you have access to your funds and we be telling you 1/2 confirmation which definitely could take hours before saying successful which is very bad of a big app like that they need to really work on it , other apps when you have your coin you’re actually allow to send out or do anything within immediately but not here on bybit and if you receive Btc when it’s going down they won’t lemme trade it cuz of the stupid 1/2 confirmation"

I install the app update, and yet the annoying pop-up still persists. Another feature that is disappointing is that all of the controls are not on the screen you want them to be so that you can execute quick trades on your mobile device; you have to move things around in order to get to what you really need for action. Earlier versions of the app were much better and user-friendly."

bybit,ios,stef2197,5,2023-01-05 14:42:28,"Bring back the ability to use drawing tools without the screen flipping on its side, the chart is to crunched up. I could use TradingView to do my analysis but I’d rather use bybits beautiful app for that. And as a trader who uses my cellphone to trade, it’s more convenient

Also adding a tool that measure percentage movement by dragging it across the chart be incredibly helpful. 

GOOO BYBIT!!!"

I sat down and said I want to take initiative and learn the crypto world, and that’s what I’ve been doing for the past 3-4 days. This app, although not supported in the USA due to regulations, is still cool to read their articles bc I learned a lot. It’s user friendly, clean, live pricing, and a LOT of options. Good job, Imma keep it."
bybit,ios,Maxx72ams,1,2024-11-24 18:00:15,"Obviously scam. I had opened account with them twice. Both times put some money to test and then got locked up for verification. They got all my ID documents and tons of personal documentation, just to reject my verification with no explanation. After that the funds are “frozen” and no response from support. Not big money, but at big scale this is how they make free money.

UPD: they’ve actually refunded my 10 eur, not sure if it’s because of this review or coincidence, but scum anyway because of so mane fake reviews."

For me, killer feature of Bybit would be risk free test environment to play around and experiment. Really helpful when you start in crypto or just want to figure out some matter. Also, design and UI are sleek and user friendly to work on without any extra help. 

Following Bybit on socials and I’m really into their policies, taking into account the modern world constant buzzing.

For example, if you go 25x leverage, the underlying can go down 4% before you should be luquidated, but bybit has a 2% safety buffer so they will liquidate you once the underlying drops 2%, and keep the remaining difference, at the price they liquidate you at, leaving you with nothing fast and the fee rebates dont work either this app needs tons of development work"

These spikes did not happen on other major exchanges.  So you could be happily in profit one moment and have a 50% SL hit in the blink of an eye. Without a system in place to absorb bizarre whale activity, it was not a safe place to trade.  I expect an exchange to keep a similar pattern as the whole market.  Hopefully they have made enhancements."

bybit,ios,nmbull,5,2024-12-03 08:25:12,"I can’t believe I stayed away from Bybit for almost six months. In hindsight, it feels like wasted time because there is nothing on the market that even comes close to Bybit’s excellence. From the moment I reopened the app, I was reminded why it’s my go-to crypto exchange. First, let’s talk about the interface—it’s sleek, intuitive, and designed with the user in mind. Whether you’re a beginner or a seasoned trader, navigating Bybit feels like second nature. Charts load instantly, the tools are advanced yet simple to use, and customization options make trading a truly personal experience. Now, their support team deserves a standing ovation. Every time I’ve had a question or issue, their team has been there, providing swift and professional assistance. They don’t just resolve problems—they make you feel valued as a customer. And the promotions? Hands down, the best in the crypto world! Bybit consistently offers bonuses, rewards, and competitions that are genuinely exciting and rewarding. No other platform offers the same level of engagement and generosity. I also have to rave about their P2P marketplace. It’s efficient, secure, and incredibly user-friendly. Buying and selling crypto has never been easier, and the variety of payment options they offer is unmatched. After coming back to Bybit, I realized how much I had missed out. Other platforms just don’t compare when it comes to reliability, features, and overall user experience. If you’re considering a crypto exchange, don’t make the mistake I did by straying—Bybit truly is in a league of its own. Bybit isn’t just a platform; it’s a partner in my trading journey. There’s no doubt in my mind: for crypto enthusiasts, Bybit is home."

bybit,ios,Ghhoghfghj,5,2023-09-01 09:50:19,"🚀💥 I've been using Bybit for a while now, and let me tell you, it's been an absolute game-changer for my trading experience. From the moment I downloaded the app, I was blown away by its user-friendly interface and intuitive design.

One of the things that sets Bybit apart is its extensive range of features. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced trader, you'll find everything you need to make informed decisions and execute trades seamlessly. The charting tools are top-notch, allowing you to analyze market trends and spot potential opportunities with ease. The order types available are also impressive, giving you the flexibility to execute trades exactly as you want.

But it doesn't stop there! Bybit also offers a range of educational resources to help you level up your trading game. From video tutorials to insightful articles, they've got you covered. Plus, their customer support team is always ready to assist you with any questions or concerns you may have.

Now, let's talk about performance. The Bybit app is lightning-fast, ensuring that you never miss out on crucial market movements. Whether you're on your phone or tablet, the app runs smoothly and delivers real-time data without any lag. It's like having a trading desk in the palm of your hand!

Security is another area where Bybit excels. They prioritize the safety of your funds and employ robust security measures to protect your account. With features like two-factor authentication and cold storage for your assets, you can trade with peace of mind.

In conclusion, the Bybit app is a must-have for any serious trader. Its user-friendly interface, extensive features, educational resources, and top-notch performance make it a solid 5 out of 5 in my book. So if you're looking to take your trading to the next level, give Bybit a try. You won't be disappointed! 🚀💯"
bybit,ios,ostap12,5,2023-06-01 11:22:24,"I have been using the Bybit app for cryptocurrency trading, and overall, it has provided me with an excellent experience. The app’s user-friendly interface, powerful features, and smooth trading process have made it my go-to platform. However, I do have a suggestion for further improvement.

One feature I would love to see in the Bybit app is the integration of a built-in wallet. Currently, I have to rely on external wallets for storing my cryptocurrencies, which can be inconvenient and potentially less secure. By introducing their own wallet feature, Bybit could offer a seamless trading and storage experience within a single app.

Having a built-in wallet would provide added convenience, allowing me to easily manage my funds without the need to switch between different applications. It would also enhance the overall security of my assets, as I could trust Bybit’s established security measures for both trading and storage.

I understand that implementing a wallet feature might involve additional considerations, such as regulatory compliance and ensuring the highest level of security. However, I believe that Bybit has the expertise and resources to create a reliable and user-friendly wallet that aligns with its commitment to providing a top-notch trading experience.

In conclusion, I highly recommend the Bybit app for its user-friendly interface, powerful features, and excellent trading experience. Bybit has the potential to further enhance its offering by introducing its own wallet feature, simplifying the management and security of users’ cryptocurrencies. I look forward to seeing this improvement in future updates."

bybit,ios,4464657,5,2024-09-07 19:57:13,"As a user, I have high expectations for the future of Bybit and Web3. Bybit has proven itself as a top-tier platform in the crypto derivatives space, with its smooth user experience and robust risk management tools offering a great deal of confidence. As the platform continues to expand its offerings into spot trading, DeFi, and staking, I hope Bybit will keep innovating and introduce more user-friendly features that cater not only to professional traders but also to everyday investors, making the crypto world more accessible.

When it comes to Web3, I’m excited by the promise of decentralization, data privacy, and user sovereignty. I hope that Bybit can play a significant role within the Web3 ecosystem by integrating more decentralized finance (DeFi) products, offering seamless cross-chain asset management, and leveraging smart contracts to enhance transparency and security. At the same time, it’s important for Bybit to remain compliant with regulations to ensure the safety of users' assets.

Looking ahead, I would love to see Bybit further immerse itself in the Web3 space, driving broader financial inclusion while safeguarding the principles of decentralization and personal autonomy. I also hope the platform continues to improve the overall user experience, providing more educational resources and tools to help newcomers easily enter the crypto market and actively participate in the Web3 ecosystem.

In short, I envision Bybit becoming a bridge between traditional finance and the Web3 world, maintaining leadership through efficiency, security, and innovation in the decentralized future."

bybit,ios,Mainul161,5,2024-05-23 11:40:57,"Bybit is a cryptocurrency exchange that offers a range of trading services, primarily focused on derivatives. Here are some key points often highlighted in reviews:

### Pros:
1. **User Interface**: Bybit is praised for its intuitive and user-friendly interface, which is suitable for both beginners and experienced traders.
2. **Leverage Trading**: Bybit offers up to 100x leverage on certain contracts, which is attractive for traders looking to maximize their positions.
3. **Security**: The platform has strong security measures, including cold storage for the majority of funds and a robust insurance fund to cover potential losses from system errors.
4. **Customer Support**: Bybit's customer service is generally well-regarded, with 24/7 support and multiple language options.
5. **No KYC Requirement**: Bybit does not require mandatory KYC for smaller withdrawals, providing more privacy for users.

### Cons:
1. **Limited Fiat Support**: Bybit has limited options for fiat currency deposits and withdrawals, which can be inconvenient for some users.
2. **Regulatory Uncertainty**: As with many crypto exchanges, Bybit operates in a regulatory gray area in some regions, which can be a concern for long-term stability.
3. **Risk of High Leverage**: While high leverage can be beneficial, it also increases the risk of significant losses, which might not be suitable for all traders.
4. **Limited Trading Pairs**: Compared to some other exchanges, Bybit offers a more limited range of trading pairs, focusing primarily on major cryptocurrencies and their derivatives.

Overall, Bybit is considered a strong choice for cryptocurrency derivatives trading due to its robust features, security, and user experience. However, users should be aware of the risks associated with high leverage trading and the regulatory environment."
bybit,ios,Ajax ki,4,2025-03-17 15:54:28,"I have some suggestions, including a promo, general functions.

Campaign Companion Hub Imagine a single dashboard showing every promotion you’ve joined, your progress, and deadlines—like a friendly guide keeping you on track. No more digging through emails or guessing if you’re eligible. Transparent status updates (“You’re 80% to unlocking your bonus!”) would reduce stress and FOMO.

notification Generic Notifications (“Don’t miss this event!”) often drown out what truly matters: your journey. Real-time progress bars, personalized tips (“Trade once more to climb the leaderboard!”), and celebratory alerts when milestones are hit could make campaigns feel less transactional and more like a shared achievement.

Process status Uncertainty erodes trust. Did your registration work? What’s next? A simple checkmark confirming your participation or a checklist of remaining tasks (“Complete 2/3 trades to qualify”) would ease anxiety. Small design touches—like a countdown timer for time-sensitive rewards—could turn confusion into confidence.

Tab design Many users live on their phones, but navigating promotions on a small screen shouldn’t feel like solving a puzzle. A dedicated mobile tab with swipeable campaign cards, one-tap registration, and glanceable progress stats would respect users’ time and on-the-go lifestyles.

 Promotions aren’t just about rewards—they’re opportunities to build relationships. By transforming campaigns from chaotic chores into guided, rewarding experiences, 
Bybit can deepen trust and turn participation into a habit. When users feel supported, they’re more likely to explore new features, stay loyal during market swings, and even advocate for the platform organically."

bybit,android,Muhammad Khizar,1,2025-03-05 23:17:03,"Bybit promotes itself as a reliable crypto trading platform, but my experience was disappointing. They advertised a 20 USDT reward for completing identity verification, but after completing the process, no reward was credited. Instead, they introduced another promotion — deposit $100 and receive 10 USDT — which felt like a bait-and-switch tactic. If a company starts with false promotions to attract users, how can anyone trust them for long-term services?"

bybit,android,Dominik Oślizło,1,2025-02-15 14:20:51,"Be warned. While it's surely a fun service, it requires extreme attention. One day you have twice what you've invested, the next day you are nearing zero (cuz: liquidation team, shrug). And if you finally decide it's not for you, you cannot withdraw the rest of your funds until you add more, you get strangely locked out in the web version, and you keep receiving email notifications even after you cancel everything, run away leaving the rest of your assets behind, and close the account. Yikes!"
bybit,android,Mintesnot Mamo (ብናልፍ),1,2025-02-15 12:27:02,The most irritating platform ever!! I encountered an issue while trading on p2p and submitted an appeal.

bybit,android,Pial hasan Fahim,1,2025-02-15 02:39:01,"I f.k bybi team.after I sent money to the Bybit seller, he did not give me the coins. After the first appeal, he rejected it. The proof that the seller gave shows his phone time as 2:26 PM but I placed the order at 7:45 PM. The seller has completed only 10 orders and I have ordered 30+ before and no seller has complained against me. But today they may have cheated me but they will get what they deserve. Those who have wasted my hard-earned money will not be happy in life. They sent me this email"
