binance,ios,James4all,5,2023-10-04 08:23:28,How can someone set stop lose and take profit Binance won’t close the market when it reach stop lose they will allow the market to liquidate you. Then what is the reason of giving your customers such options if is not working. I wake up today with a very sad mood. Because I set up a stop lose on my future trades and wake up this morning that they didn’t close the market for when the stop lose reach until I was liquidated and lost all my money. It’s better not to give us such options so we can monitor our trades by ourselves since you can’t close market with stop lose or take profit until the person lose all his money.
binance,ios,Zionsb,1,2023-05-24 00:13:10,"I have been using Binance for a little bit, even promoting it on my website. I made a serious purchase a couple months ago of about 2-3 Bitcoin, about $50k, along with my partner who also spent about 50k, so 6 figures total. When the transaction was made, the money was transferred out of our bank accounts, but no Bitcoin was added to the wallet. We waited 3-4 days for the transaction to go through and nothing. We started contacting and found out that our money was sent, but our Bitcoin was being withheld for no reason. There was no reason this should’ve happened since we bought it through the app especially for longer than a week . We were communication with a middle man for months trying to figure out why our Bitcoin was not being sent to us and all we got were excuses saying they were trying their best and that we were being rude. We stopped using Binance on our website and they got upset with us saying that it was unnecessary and that they don’t understand why we would stop using their services. Been about 6 months and still no word. Our money is long gone and if you use this app to purchase more than a couple hundred dollars worth of tokens, they will take your money as well."
binance,ios,Username: Courtney,2,2021-04-11 18:25:51,"The only thing good about the app is it’s interface. If I didn’t have this one problem I would be obsessed with the app. The customer support is basically non existent. You have to submit a ticket if you have an issue, but don’t express a response. I’ve attempted over 300 times to purchase crypto directly and deposit money to my account, and only TWO times did I find success. I was allowed two times to purchase crypto directly from my linked bank account. I’ve deleted and add my bank 100 times, that doesn’t work. I’ve submitted multiple tickets. No response. I’m transferring the very little crypto I was allowed to purchase to a wallet and I’m switching over to another app.

It’s very upsetting because the app offers a variety of crypto and low fees. The only thing I can’t do is purchase the crypto. It seems like a lot of people have this problem so I wonder how they even make money. My recommendation: get a better customer support, or fix the issue that everyone seems to be having"
binance,ios,joshdammit,1,2023-06-15 10:57:52,"Got an email last week saying binance is shutting down USD withdrawals due to the SEC suing them. We have until the 13th to get our withdrawals in. I deposited my ADA from a wallet and sold it on the 9th. Received my confirmation email immediately and clicked the link on it. “Pending” for several days.

This morning, it’s listed as “failed.” It’s now past their cutoff date and I have nearly $500 stuck in their account. I reached out to chat several days ago to confirm the withdrawal was going to be okay and was told there’d be a high wait time and I’d get a notification on my phone when an agent was available. I never got anything until early, early, early this morning while I’m asleep I get an email notifying me an agent has been trying to reach me. They closed the chat. Still no notifications, they just left me in the dark all weekend while they ran the clock so they wouldn’t have to give me my money.

Binance is a scam operation and they deserve whatever lawsuits come their way."
binance,ios,King Banks M,1,2021-05-05 17:13:25,"I’ve been trying to buy crypto for a while now I created my account and sent personal verification and I’ve been waiting literally weeks for this to be verified. I had a few crypto stocks I wanted to add huge investments to but could not even buy them due to my account not being verified, I tried to contact customer support and they have an automatic set up you can’t contact them through email, and filing a ticket doesn’t even matter because they won’t get back to you. To top it off they do not have a phone number to talk to an actually person, if you use the app and have this same issue, I’d advise not to call any of the number google or the random websites say is Binance’s phone number they’re obvious scams. I deactivated my account and deleted the app and told my friends about my experience if I get a response back describing my situation to help me understand what happen along with a phone number or actually non-automatic email I’ll change the review."
binance,ios,Jay T 2402,4,2021-11-16 14:47:55,"Unfortunately the mobile app has recently changed regarding the drawing of trend lines. This app was absolutely fantastic to draw trends, change past drawn lines and being able to see approximately the date of intersecting trends. There was no announcement of the update/changes and I want Binance to read this feedback so as to change things back to what they were. The app was a well deserved 5 star rating but now it is not as helpful as it was. 
Even on stochastic indicators, trend lines and cursor could be dragged over to see values of RSI, KDJ and so on easily, user-friendly like no other app. 

Kindly correct this easy step to assist the functionality of your trading app and provide your customers with an experience that can’t be beaten by your competitors. Thank you"
binance,ios,Tammmmmmz,1,2021-06-17 03:22:32,"When markets move in a favorable direction many users reported their accounts locked. Check Twitter for details of customers begging to get their accounts unlocked. I’ve been a Binance customer since 2017, already authenticated, and verified multiple times. My account was locked  from February through May 2021 on both Binance and Binance US. Magically, my accounts were unlocked after market took a steep dive. Binance, virtually offers no customer support, no phone to call, no follow up email. You will only get an acknowledgment email to confirm that customer support received your complaints.  I tried hundreds of times without a response. I moved to my accounts their main competitor. FTC needs to jump in and regulate.

Check the reviews, too many users have similar experience. Binance uses our Crypto to trade for their own benefit, could explain locked accounts. Cheats. Doesn’t make sense this app received more than 2 stars review."
binance,ios,cmj141,4,2020-06-07 21:21:03,"The exchanges GUI is cluttered. I end up touching something I didn’t mean to touch because all the buttons are close to each other. I understand they want this to be user friendly by placing everything in the open so nothing is hidden but it just makes everything messy. Add menus and you can free up space on the GUI. It’s hard increasing and decreasing price of coins we are selling in the exchange without hitting something else and causing the screen to swipe. Same goes for the amount buttons to increase and decrease the amount of coins we are selling and buying in the exchange screen. 

Also id like to be able to see market/price history on the buy/sell screen so I can see how much a coin was being sold for last month as I’m pricing it for selling without having to change screens and go to the other market tab to engage prices. 

Oh and most importantly there should be a note when selling coins that there’s a bare minimum of .1 before we go to sell our coins. I wasted time setting up a coin to sell just to find out afterwards I didn’t have enough coins to sell which wasted minutes of my time. So minimums and other rules should be made visible at all times. 

Other than that it’s a good app. 4 stars."
binance,ios,Ceejay ijeh,5,2023-05-15 23:53:07,"This is the 4th time, you give the buyer over estimated time, after the time is up for investigation, you haven’t cancelled trade. I have sent 6 proofs and videos to show the buyer is not cooperating or communicating, the buyer hasn’t sent a single proof and Binance is still yet to cancel trade. You should stick to your rules. Once the time is up for both parties , you cancel, this started this year. Last year wasn’t like this. I’m a very upset customer. I have been awake from 4pm till now 1 am waiting for the trade to be cancelled and nothing from buyer or Binance. Please look into my appeal now"
binance,ios,Lovesmuggler,1,2020-02-04 17:08:37,"In 2018 I opened a Binance account, and to this day they will not let me withdraw money from it.  Every time I complete some task to verify who I am, they come up with another one.  Tell me the IP you first logged in from in 2018 and the date.  Send us an ID pic.  Oh not that one a different kind.  Oh not that one it’s dirty.  Now we are to the point they are asking me for multiple IDs, and recording a VIDEO of myself showing the date and IDs and myself logged into the page and they STILL are responding back saying things like “oh you didn’t say this right” and “you need to also video your withdrawal history” (which doesn’t exist because they won’t let me withdraw”.  This site is not safe to use for people on the US, they are justifying keeping my withdrawal functions turned off because I’m in the US, but they were happy to let me deposit money.  PLEASE save yourself the frustration and don’t put money into this site it’s possible you will never retrieve it."
binance,ios,Comander fox,4,2021-08-14 06:39:35,"I love binance for buying/selling crypto. However, a couple updates back i noticed a sudden change in performance when you enter trade charts, open the buy/sell menu, and leave trading charts in particular where the app consistently stalls for a one or two second period before the action is carried out. This used to not happen and makes it difficult to quickly switch between trades and buy or sell on mobile. These used to happen almost instantly. It would be really helpful if this delay could be sorted out. I’ve had to resort to the website for these actions because this delay makes quick trading decisions impossible during busy market movements."
binance,ios,NANOBIN,5,2021-08-12 06:20:19,"Being the largest crypto exchange platform while having the WORST customer support team with horrifying experience. I am a legacy user since 2018, and the account is restricted with several thousand dollar in it. Contacted support three times, each time transferred to a “specialist” with no follow up at all. Submitted ticket, with no avail and no real person attends to the case. Seems like luring you in and not allowing you to withdraw is their business model. Run away from this hypocritical service as fast as you can, or find a better alternative."
binance,ios,Aznttboy,1,2021-05-26 08:29:50,"Cryptocurrencies might be Binance’s game, they might actually be fairly good at it (have yet to get hacked to the point of shutting down; owner have not run off with investors crypto assets). But the entire registration and verification process is broken as F___! And from the family and friends that told me their personal experiences about Binance, I can keep trying (to infinity) or give up.  Binance is that bad, at least with ID verification and proof of address, etc.  the advice is to keep trying, uploading the same PDF document and with any luck, 6 months later, it will magically get approved.

I supposed it could be a Robinhood app, and Binance will disrupt trading, force liquidate positions, just because they are undercapitalized and think they can do it without legal and civil ramifications. 

Oh, the Binance mobile app and their website can’t agree on my login credentials either. At first I thought I downloaded the wrong app and my login is actually being sent to the database of a phishing con artist. Luckily it is just horrible UI, flawed end user usability issue, that even a novice Software QA tester can identify and document for a high priority bug fix report.

1 star, because 0.5 star or lower is not an option."
binance,ios,Kingjoses,1,2021-05-15 03:09:56,I don’t understand how this company became one of the biggest crypto platforms this company is terrible the verification process is almost impossible face scan and ID don’t work customer service is nonexistent absolutely terrible I tried over 20 times to get verified and every time it says ID not supported which makes no sense and anytime you try to contact customer service you get no help they even penalized for trying to ask for help to many times i’m just trying to figure out how to delete my account from this garbage app so they don’t keep my information they also ask you for so much personal information more then any other crypto platforms in the United States so it makes no sense how it take this long for people to get verified garbage company don’t waste your time use coinbase or coinbase  pro

Only complaint. I took part in the launch of the GOAL token when it launched and lost my entire capital in less than 5 mins of it launching. Kept my money in but it never grew pass 20 dollars even though my initial investment was 100. It went from 100 to 2 dollars in seconds then back to 20 and never recovered.

binance,ios,king afghanistan,5,2024-05-10 04:23:38,"1. Wide range of cryptocurrencies: Binance offers a vast selection of cryptocurrencies to trade, including some lesser-known and newer coins.

2 Competitive fees: Binance's fees are generally lower than many other cryptocurrency exchanges, making it an affordable option for traders.

3. High liquidity: Due to its large user base and extensive trading volumes, Binance has high liquidity, which allows for faster and more efficient trading.

Yes I use Yubikey on the desktop app...so a little bit of help explaining what to do about it would be helpful. I see others are having the same issue, yet Binance who needs to learn about customer service and UX/UI design need to get their act together!

I gave up and went to Bitrue which is a much better experience on desktop and mobile. Unfortunately some altcoins don’t trade on Bitrue, and I trade mostly on my phone as I’m always on the go. So Binance...get your act together because sooner rather than later more traders will find other exchanges that have a good customer support and user interface than what you are offering now!!!"

Figured it was safe, and didnt know binance couldn’t be used in the US anymore. They told me to withdraw my funds, but then when I tried to withdraw they actually blocked my transfer. Then told me I needed to verify, which I already did with my ID in order to get into my account. So now they are telling me in order to withdraw my funds I must verify, but won’t let me verify, because it asks for your country of origin and US isn’t even an option. So I can’t even do what they’re telling me I need to do in order to get my crypto out! Nobody replies back for the help chat or email. They’ll rob you if they get the chance. Do not use Binance!!"

I should go outside and risk my life taking a video of my phone with another phone showing how I am going to log in to my bank ok what if I didn't have another phone but I then used my girlfriend photos for the task but after everything it was all a waste of time and the money was for the completion of my rent, till now I have not been able to retrieve my money.

When it comes to crypto trading I would only Prefer Binance. The most amazing thing about Binance is their TradingBots which are incredible, but still needs some refinements. Such as Bots should have TP and SL to minimise risk and maximise profits. With such improvements Bots would be more profitable. They should also add other AI based Bots to Automatically trades based on current market Situations. Please Pay attention to Bots ."
binance,ios,Mamah Collins,4,2023-10-08 05:10:44,"Hi, very wonderful app you got here. I enjoy every moment working with it, not every moment, but most of it. Please, and please I will love it if you guys can modify a setting that deactivate buyers who aren’t available/online to trade/buy assets, at least until they are back online. Sometimes, we need to make urgent trades, but when buyers are not available it ruins a lot of things for us, hence we have to wait till the trade is cancelled before we can move forward with a different trader, and that’s a long time. 
Thank you very much. 
Keep up the good work."
binance,ios,Bazcas,1,2022-04-06 17:16:26,"The reviews advising of all the trouble receiving MFA codes, text, email, and Authenticator apps are spot on. It is an absolute nightmare trying to do anything but buy on this platform. Text never show, Authenticator app codes timeout pending no show emails and texts, resend options lock for a minute each time when nothing has been sent. It’s almost like it’s built into the platform to do this because the struggles are literally the same total timeframe each and every day tested. You can actually map it from day to day and the total time and “loop” it sends you in trying to withdraw funds is the same every day. This platform is very bad, and I’d recommend going somewhere else for crypto exchange."
binance,ios,upin347,5,2022-06-29 09:07:28,"I think Binance is a very efficient and easy to understand trader's place, because there are pro and non-pro modes. In addition, there are many features that other exchanges don't have such as futures contracts, margin, staking, NFT, p2p and many others. On the security side, Binance has also done well by adding Face ID and 2FA to secure your account. Moreover, there are many interesting events that Binance often conducts such as competition trading. This makes binance suitable for people all over the world."

The exchange window is extremely glitchy now, always freezes, will display BTC/USDT order book when I am trying to see another coin, will not refresh pages smoothly if it even refreshes at all, crashes often... it just isn’t as reliable anymore. The isolated margin actions such as borrow, repay, and transfer are glitchy as well. Non-executed orders don’t show up like they used to now, requires ~5 refresh attempts now. I used to rely on the app when the website slowed down, but now I can’t trust it. Please fix back to the way it was."
binance,ios,TheLukeShort,1,2021-09-30 08:31:38,"I was one of Binance’s first customers in 2017

I’ve held BNB since it was less than $1 and still hold it. 

Well now that CZ is kicking us off after giving in to supporting all that goes against crypto, I no longer can use it even with a VPN. 

So I temporarily went over to Binance U.S. but they stole $50,000 from me the first month I was there a year ago and never gave it back because they messed up my KYC. 

They stole $96,000 from another friend that nearly bankrupt him right when he had his first child.

They stole around $20k from another friend who attempted to self harm himself when he couldn’t get help to get his life savings back. 

It’s wrong. 

Then CZ allows Brian Brooks, a criminal, to run Binance U.S. like this with no customer service or care for people’s lives.

The person on Twitter said they were fixing it this time and making special effort to get it right 47 times! And they never remembered me after each time. 

I never got my money back, but bad things are coming for the entire Binance name, so stay far away or you’ll likely end up like me and my friends."

Yeah,  one can know the P/L per day but it would be nice to see an average cost per position as well as the portfolio P/L. For instance, if I keep buying ETH, I would like to see how much I paid on average for each ETH and how much is the P/L vs that average cost.

It’s been 3 months since I’ve created the account and they cannot verify me. Come to find out they’ve removed the option to deactivate your account only leaving the disable(pause) option. When you reach out to customer service it’s a continuous loop redirecting you to “how to disable” instructions. The worst part about all this is that they claim the right to retain all of your private information for 6 years after deactivation. They’re robot email states that in their reply but yet they don’t help you deactivate. Avoid this platform at all cost.

They stated that I didn’t need to verify if I was only withdrawing, which was my intention. However my account was purposely locked, so they can take my assets hostage to force me to accept the biometric data collection. On top of that when asking them to delete your account and data, which is your right, they play dumb saying you cannot and make you jump through hoops to get it done. Very shady business practices, go use a platform with better customer service."

I tried to complete my registration to Binance site but at the end I found that My country (Iraq) is not listed and some kind of ban for Iraq and some countries,, 
With respect to your regulation but seems no sense to put few countries in like this list , because if there is a law or regulations or ban should applicate for any kind of illegal financial transection or political issues should be done for many and many other countries accepted already for registration in your site,  that we know they are the way for illegal world money transfer and money laundry.
 plus all operations normally under control by you and the international government (if I understood your site policy well).
So please review this point very well and under the rights of using internet and its applications I would like to ask you kindly to explain your reasons to put a ban on my country and other five or six countries.

Wish my email will have your high consideration.

Best Regards."

What’s the point of that??? By that point I already don’t want the stock and I’m likely to lose money. 

Hey binance. How about you give us the price of the stock we had at the time of purchase numbnuts. Frustrating. I hate this app."

- turn off email marketing
- change account settings or remove linked financial information
- close the account

What happened to having SEPA enabled accounts in places like Germany and Estonia for God sakes where they have better crypto knowledge. Coinbase is using Estonia what’s really happening to the team in charge of payment. Are they thinking as fast as they paid

(see youtube please for further assistance).

coinbase,ios,dank0116,5,2021-10-11 01:28:16,I am impressed by how easy this app is to use.  There is endless amounts of information about cryptocurrency on Coinbase and if it is t there u can be connected to it.  I had been weary about crypto but when I heard about Coinbase I was originally in getting shares of it when it went public.  When I was unable to get the stock and it went through the roof right off like had figured we’ll that is when I decided to download and check it out.  Coinbase gave me a small amount for down loading the app and then through the learn and earn feature I was able to learn what crypto is and does but also get like four different currencies.  The ease of operation of the app made it very i intimidating and I continued to learn about crypto amd now I’m trading almost daily.  I also had some support issues with my Coinbase card and they were quickly replied to and I was given some basic help which was unable to solve the problem but they sent my issue up the support chain and my Coinbase card was fully operational the next morning.  I say thank you to Coinbase for making it easy for me to learn and operate trading with crypto currency’s because it has been easy making money.
coinbase,ios,Stevenra14,4,2025-01-23 03:06:29,"Really good app for crypto beginners and intermediate users. But I wish the integration of Coinbase advanced/basic side was better. One example is the alerts, why can’t I just set custom price alerts while on Coinbase advanced? That would save a lot of time. Same thing with checking my staking rewards and coins, why can’t I check these in advanced also? I have to switch advanced off to do these things. It really should be on both sides of the app. One real big complaint I have and issue I have found many other people have is the ability to link your bank account without using plaid. This is a big red flag for me. It used to work very long ago but at some point was made basically useless. The manual linking will still show up but it never actually works. No matter what bank you have. Coinbase support will just push you to use plaid which is just very weird when linking a bank account manually is the industry standard. This also is the case on desktop, not just the app. I do not want to use plaid and give my bank login to a third party regardless of how safe you guys say it is. Other than these three things I mentioned the app is nice, clean and works well. But I really wish these updates/fixes were implemented. Appreciate all the effort you guys put in, keep up the good work!"
coinbase,ios,Robinhoodallday,1,2024-10-22 02:53:25,"I use Coinbase for about three years and was happy with their service until halfway through this year. I don’t know what has changed with it. They’ve just got enough customers that they feel they don’t need to worry about how they treat individuals I guess I would say. I signed up for the Coinbase one membership to get rid of all the hydrating fees they charge and it does help though they’re still hidden fees every time we buy trading something in the “spread” so be aware of that even though it says zero fees are still paying $.10-$.50 per trade.  They may randomly just lock your account with no explanation and then if you ask for a refund on anything and your account locked, never funded and crypto so it’s still locked. They still have your money so they never give your money back. I have currently been locked out of my account since the day before my birthday so about two weeks now I have spent roughly 8 hours on the phone with Customer Service to try to find out why I get the same party line every time that the system didn’t like something OK so go in and freaking change it that’s why you have humans working there, but on the upside, that’s how I discovered using Robin Hood much cheaper much more friendly service much quicker and easier. I recommend Robin Hood because between the SEC against Coinbase and they’re treating their users. I just don’t see a bright future form. I’m currently with what they have basically stolen my money."
coinbase,ios,CPG Tiberius,1,2024-11-11 20:08:17,"It is absolutely mind boggling how unhelpful and circular their customer support is. There is no email link to create a ticket for resolving issues, instead they default to a chat bot that references sources to the same circular solutions. Solutions that do not work. I have been bouncing around the website trying to troubleshoot my issue (I’m trying to update my phone number) and there is not a single piece of reference material for me to do this that actually works. In my account through the browser, I can see an option to update my number. When I select it, it wants me to verify my account. How does it want me to verify? Through SMS. I don’t have that number. I select try another way and when I provide my email it just logs me back into my account right where I started. There is no where for me to send an email to speak with someone and there are no representatives that I can physically call. This is THE LARGEST crypto trading app and they are making hundreds of millions of dollars on trades. How can they not afford customer support or even an email for me to create a ticket? It’s absolute insanity. I need my number updated because my account automatically removed my bank when signing in on a new device and I have 40k just sitting there and I can’t do anything about it. I can’t imagine a banking service having absolutely zero customer support. I would stop banking with them immediately. Unfortunately my funds are locked or I would stop using Coinbase."
coinbase,ios,Vanzator,1,2024-07-04 01:42:30,"Story goes like this, I’m using coinbase everyday, checking prices and buying whatever I find as a good deal. Strangely today I get unlogged next step I’m trying to get back into the account. Here comes the coinbase support which I would rate as 0. I do not have the phone number from Denmark which I had and I didn’t put up to date, my fault, I admit, but on the other side coinbase it’s asking for my id or my driver license to get my account back, after 10 attempts (at least 10 let’s make it 20) finally tired of doing it I’m trying to get in touch with a live agent, in this case if you want to talk with a live agent thru text you have to be logged in(how can I do that in my case!!!), then I’m trying to call them, pressing the buttons to direct me, the robot tells me that I need to get to the coinbase page in order to obtain my account back I have to send pictures with my id or driver license and to film me while I spoke my code(back and forth doing the same thing I did at first). Now the last time I’m trying and they blocked me for too many attempts. Congratulations Coinbase, why in the earth it’s so difficult to get my account back while I’m sending you videos with myself doing exactly what you told me. It’s just driving me crazy, no email to reach you, no phone number, how am I supposed to get my account back? 
Am I going to get a response on this platform at least? Or is it going to be ignored like all my other attempts 🙂"
coinbase,ios,caseyishappy,1,2022-08-12 00:19:12,"On November 25th I tried to transfer my btc to another wallet and I was told the transaction would be on hold due to security reasons and I had to upload my ID. It wouldn’t let me so I let it go and waited the 3 days it said it would take. Well flash forward 5 days, I had completely forgotten about it and hurried to check both accounts and my email since I know I never received it. Somehow the account I had tried to transfer it to said I received the btc on November 23rd which would’ve been impossible. I tried to contact support for both accounts and got a couple of unhelpful, “it was deposited,” replies. Flash forward again to tax season and I had my tax documents from both account that say the $500 was deposited on the 23rd but Coinbase transferred it on the 26th. I showed them that and showed the other account I haven’t even been able to spend $500 to reach the $0 I was at so the math doesn’t add up either but not even an apology was given from either companies. I saw someone else review Coinbase with the same exact issue a few days after me so I’m sure Coinbase knows their system messed up in November but don’t care. I had put $500 in Coinbase for emergencies and I was kicked out of my apartment after a medical emergency so I was in an double emergency and Coinbase made it a triple emergency and cost me a roof over my head for the mistakes they don’t seem to acknowledge. I don’t even know how many emergencies that all comes out to now."
coinbase,ios,Mbev0391,1,2022-01-31 21:22:16,"I’ve had this app for a while now to do simple investing. Recently, I decided to get into NFTs and wanted to transfer crypto into its compatible wallet. When doing so, I was sent an email saying that I needed to verify my ID, and if I didn’t, there would be a 72 hour delay. I verified my ID and received a message saying that verification was successful. After 20-30 minutes of waiting for my wallet to populate with my crypto, the balance still said $0. I sent it to the correct wallet address before anyone asks. I reached out to their support team just to be have the conversation end abruptly by the agent. So the next morning, I message again to ask where it is. This was a Saturday. He then told me that it will be in my wallet on Sunday. Sunday rolls around, and it’s not there. I contact them AGAIN and the agent tells me she sees it’s being worked on and there’s a 72 hour delay. I explained i did the ID verification successfully and there shouldn’t be a delay. She said “that’s the protocol” and ended the conversation thread!!! I contact them TODAY (Monday) and they can’t give me any answers or a timeline. I needed the crypto today for a mint on an NFT and now I’ve missed out on several thousand dollars because of this poor way of Coinbase doing things. This is unacceptable especially when people are trying to make money through your platform!!! There are other platforms out there so it would be beneficial if you search elsewhere."
coinbase,ios,Cova13,1,2022-01-04 01:40:46,"So this is my first app that I used for investing, had my hopes up but the customer service really brought down my motivation for using this app. Honestly i regret downloading it. Once I had downloaded the app I went through the whole process to be able to start buying and selling but once I tried buying through my chase account that I had already linked and yes I did everything exactly how the app demanded it, but it still wouldn’t let me buy because of suspicious activity. So I contact their help support, after telling the bot to put me in contact with a person since the bot was not being helpful at all. Turns out theirs nobody you can call it’s all through text and once I explain my problem he would just tell me to put my id and a pic which I already had done so I re-did the process and still nothing change I kept telling him that but he would keep sending me the same message about putting my id and pic it almost seem like he was just sending me texts he had save in his system. So once he finally realize that his way wasn’t working he send my problem to be check by someone else where I got an email saying that they where checking my account and around six days they would get back to me I open up my email today and I see an email from them saying that they close my case without even fixing nothing. I have to give it to them they really know how to frustrate someone"
coinbase,ios,Zeus Monkey,1,2023-02-09 00:42:19,"I had Coinbase loaded onto my phone since early 2020. As of last week, they updated it and it requires an iOS of 14.0. I have gotten the most recent update of my iOS to 12.5.7, so the app will not work on my phone. I thought, OK, I’ll just go to the website. Nope. Cannot sign on there. There’s no place to sign in on the website. I tried sending an email by clicking the “Contact Us” link. It doesn’t work. None of the options work. I did a Google search for a Coinbase email address for support, and found a couple. One worked but said they no longer responded to emails, and directed me to click a link. That link took me back to the same previous “Contact Us” page where nothing works. There is no way to contact them about not being able to access the app or site. Pitiful customer service.

 I’m glad I never invested with Coinbase. The cryptocurrencies I received there were earned by doing the tasks required to get free crypto. I was testing it out to see how it would go. My crypto grew slowly to nearly $60, but then the bottom dropped out of sight. The last time I was able to check, my crypto was only worth about $8, where it had been hovering for a while. The $5 in Bitcoin I’d received was only worth about $1.50. I wouldn’t trust cryptocurrencies, not any more than I trust Coinbase... which is not at all. It won’t let me put in a “ZERO” choice of stars, so one it is."
coinbase,ios,Doggs/doggerino/doggpounds,5,2022-01-20 22:36:04,"Welcome to the new consumer savings account. As a consumer alone in the crypto jungle i am sometimes saddened by the limits of coin base yet the security and trust in whats offered upon the simple coinbase acct.  is reasonable i believe.  The house always wins and i guess it should if it upholds a service and commitment to said service. Accepting i am not a trader on the coinbase platform knowing this and accepting that i must HODL as a savings acct. is one of the greatest experiences i have had personally on my device. 
   A greater level of customer engagement would be a great value increase for the reputation of the app.  Log in issues and quirks can not be related our consulted upon in any real way so beyond standard FAQ’s i have been left alone to understand certain quirks. It may be different on the fancier wallet or counbase pro i would not know cause i am not a trader i am merely a crypto addict who cant get enough btc! And squirrels away any pocket change i can ! 
 If you believe in btc and its synenergy to eradicate poverty in a large part, then i’d recommend a coinbase acct for yourself and family to build wealth for everyone on the planet.  With Aloha. &  Ma’at."
coinbase,ios,Shmyizer,3,2024-03-23 21:21:15,"I’ll start with saying since I’ve had Coinbase I’ve had very minimal issues. I’m giving only 3 stars because there’s basic fundamentals that should be in any type of “investing/trading” app. For example how much money a person (CURRENTLY) has invested in Coinbase. Example: Cost Basis for your Coinbase portfolio and for each individual crypto that a person buys. You should also be able to see your cost basis for each individual crypto you’re currently invested in. I think the “All time returns” is confusing and makes trying to figure out how much you’ve gained on different trades all the more confusing. Especially when you go to my assets a click on the crypto you’re currently invested in the only info you get is your total returns. Meaning if you bought and sold a crypto over a year ago and then bought the same crypto a year later it just adds all your gains together therefore you cannot tell how much you’re up for that current trade. I think Coinbase needs to seriously invest their time in fixing the fundamentals as they make it extremely confusing to understand how much you actually have invested in each crypto. They’re very simple features, I’m not really sure how this hasn’t been added yet considering they’re one of the largest public crypto exchanges."
coinbase,ios,kobe4la,1,2023-07-17 07:38:21,Had several thousands in xrp coins go missing under Coinbase over the period of years. I’m no expert in crypto but I still kind of have the jist of things going on. Couple of years ago xrp was delisted on Coinbase so we could no longer buy or sell xrp. But Coinbase said ok your xrp is still safe and secure in your Coinbase account. So ok I just left it there. Then a few months later they wanted you to transfer it to a Coinbase wallet because they didn’t want any responsibility for it. Ok I transferred it there so I do see it. Then the coins were transferred or moved out of Coinbase wallet and just disappeared. I guess they wanted to use my coins to “ stake” in their program or something. I emailed them and they said your coins are safe and you gotta do this laundry list of things but I always get an error. Let I remind you guys this was over the course of over two years. I hardly trade any coins I bought a bunch in 2021 and had the intention of just leaving it and forgetting it. Now in 2023 my coins are gone. Sure I accept responsibility I shoulda used a Trezor and kept my coins outside of Coinbase but I trusted them too much. I know I’ll just get a generic AI response to this but I just wanted to get the word out of what happened. Just like with many crypto exchanges it’s all a hoax. Only put money in if what your willing to lose entirely. They will make it very difficult to recover or ever get your money back.
coinbase,ios,1&24,1,2024-04-27 04:05:06,"I don’t know what’s going on with Coinbase, but when I first started using them and their wallet, it was very simple to use. Everything was done easily and you didn’t have that many problems switching over from the Wallet to Coinbase platform. Then they started adding all of this to Wallet​, making it difficult to transfer your money or to send money back-and-forth. I just was taken for over $650 because they are telling me I sent money from one wallet that is mines to another wallet that is mine but the token is not supported so I asked him my money back to the wallet and they’re telling me that they can’t can’t you this is not a decentralized platform like I don’t understand what’s going on and it doesn’t make sense. They stole my money and it’s not trying to help me get it back. They’re making it on purpose. It’s better off using a decentralized platform where you know that it’s a possibility of you losing your money then to be on Coinbase with the monitoring you and you can still lose your money have high transaction fees, and there’s no customers service to help you do anything, this is the second time something happened to me like the first time was with someone from somewhere else use my card from another country and they give me my money back. I’m just done with this. It doesn’t make sense now. I’m lost over $650 and they’re not even trying to help me."
coinbase,ios,Yeyet222,1,2022-03-28 04:27:17,"Ive been introduced to coinbase by a scam who claimed to be from coinbase wallet wanting to invite people in liquidity mining to gain it’s user base, like a promotion. I trusted it because it was an app launched from coinbase wallet. My understanding is it is my account and I hv full control of it, just like I have full control of my bank account, and all the apps launched from my bank account should be legible. That’s how I got tricked. The fact is, once I launch the app from coinbase wallet, I’ve signed “smart contract” which allows third party to withdraw from my coinbase wallet indefinitely. At first I thought coinbase is definitely responsible for allowing the scammer app to launch from their app, but it turns out that they deny the liability claiming in crypto world it is always “ur decision to make”, that freaked me out because it can legally allow anyone to take users money away without putting on any warning, which is even worse than real world. How can online bank account launch third party app without warning people it is possibly a scam and it has nothing to do with the bank, it is not hard to do so in coinbase and they refuse to put that warning, causing lots of ppl losing money from scam. I have full proof that the scammer claimed to be from coinbase and it is app launched from coinbase which made it more believable. Why can’t coinbase put on warning? Btw I lost 100k thx to coinbase!"
coinbase,ios,Madd Modder,1,2022-05-26 19:28:08,"Coinbase requires a valid government issued ID to send & receive anything. In states with “True ID” you don’t get a physical ID card the day of the transaction. It is mailed & doesn’t come until 10-15 days after getting your photo taken. Once that’s done the license authorizing place will issue a temporary license on paper. Coinbase will not accept this as a valid license. They require a physical plastic card license. Coinbase will allow you to deposit money but won’t allow you to send or receive anything until you have acquired your physical license. So, if you’ve already put money into your coinbase account at this point it’s now locked up and can’t be transferred until the physical plastic ID card has arrived. The only option you have is to withdraw back to the original bank account you sent it from. On top of that, if you attached a bank account and didn’t use wire transfer, your transferred funds are now on hold for approximately 5-7 business days. There is no warning or requirements that alert the user to need to complete their ID verification before transferring money into the coinbase account & that you will not be able to send or receive funds. Also, if you use an attached bank account that you transferred funds from into your coinbase, that money is subject to a hold time of appropriately 5-7 business days. This company has been one big headache"
coinbase,ios,sj-2020,1,2022-04-18 23:06:32,"Coinbase seems to be the dominant crypto trading platform in the US, but this app is not by any chance close to a professional trading app! I read a ""Thank You"" review by another user because he had noticed the addition of ""Watchlist"" and ""New Coins"" to the app!! This is as childish as it can imaginably be! Are you guys at kindergarten or what?! Any trader, not the professional stock market traders, but even an average joe will realize how primitive coinbase app is! Cryptos are being traded 24/7 and we definitely need candle stick charts with technical indicators. What do we get with this app? A childish graph with absolutely NO indicators, NO candles, NO settings, basically NOTHING! The graphs are absolutely useless. I wonder if coinbase users trade by tossing coins or what?!! There are absolutely no helpful market tools such as filters, simple scanners, or any activity monitoring tools either. The watchlist is so primitive and lacks even the most basic functionality such as sorting. Any time I open this app I start hating to trade on this platform! Is there anyone at coinbase who has ever traded stocks?! I'm sure there is, and they know exactly how low profile this app is! But they have no serious will to upgrade it to something better probably because they feel they are not rivaled by any competitor! So, they keep their high commission fees and they do nothing to improve! What a shame!"
coinbase,ios,Dadsmash,1,2023-04-12 23:29:17,"Most importantly, I do not want anyone to have funds made unavailable and avoid painful situations. Always do a test send to and from Coinbase in small amounts this will ensure there are no net work issues or software bugs, resulting in potential loss of funds. Even if you have used that methods before it may change by the day or software update. Saved addresses will display the correct hash but may not always accurately apply saved memos. Unacceptable delays in send/receive timeframes exceed standards (coinbase claims to use a third party hot wallet service that is inefficient, slow, and potentially not liable for coinbase software/tech issues).

It’s unfortunate that coinbase is outperformed, overshadowed, and obsolete compared to almost every other exchange. It may be age of the company or the challenges to operate on the US, but as soon as the regulatory hurdles are cleared coinbase will be left in the dust if they don’t revamp the platform. A simple action such as sending XLM has become an overwhelming liability. I have had more money than I care to admit held hostage by coinbase due to technical issues when in fact it was all caused by the inadequate software used by CB and incompetent engineers. I am surprised that there have not been more complaints or worse from dissatisfied customers. If there were Breyer on ramp options in the US I would gladly forget this company and app."
coinbase,ios,MyBlackShirt,3,2021-10-28 22:56:30,"So this app is great for trading/purchasing crypto.  I’ve used it for nearly a year with no issues.  Now that this is out of the way:

The number of times that changes have occurred to the interface, then changed back, then changed to the prior version, then another…it’s maddening.  Here are my priorities: 1. See my portfolio balance and trajectory over (x) period. 2. See the coins I have and how they have faired over (x) period.  3. See what are the top movers over (x) period.  4. Trade one coin for another. 
When I can no longer do one of the above because of a UI change that adds functionality that is not one of my priorities, it is frustrating.  When I have no method of customizing the UI for my priorities to get it back, it’s frustrating.  When one of the missing priorities returns and then is removed or changed in a way that feels as if it were removed…it is frustrating.  
I’d rather not be frustrated, so please don’t remove features, if you must put something else in the UI, provide me with means to discover where the feature I care for is now located.  This will allow you to continue to experiment with new features while allowing me to continue to achieve my goals."
coinbase,ios,theo749,3,2022-12-07 21:56:26,"Update: the developer fixed the issue I had with logging in. The aspect ratio is somewhat improved but not great. The main issue I’m noticing now is that on the home tab, I’m unable to scroll or otherwise interact in any way with the screen. Everything seems to work fine in the other tabs. I’ve updated my rating from one star to 3 and will raise it to 5 once the remaining bugs are fixed. I appreciate the quick response, hopefully these bugs will also be resolved soon.

Old review: The other day, I got a notification that my portfolio had been migrated from Coinbase pro to Coinbase. I’m not sure why the developers decided to do this, Coinbase pro worked well enough but it wouldn’t have been been an issue if the Coinbase app worked on my iPad Pro. Why I opened the app, the screen was obviously designed for a phone, not a tablet. I had the same issue with pro but at least pro was still useable. With the Coinbase app, when I went to enter my email, the keyboard wouldn’t let me type in numbers. I have a lot of assets tied up in Coinbase, not being able to access it is a major problem. Please fix this bug and make a iPad friendly aspect ratio option."
coinbase,ios,tmshureih,5,2023-05-04 22:22:26,"I opened my account with Coinbase in January 2021. Since then, and me hardly trading or moving my money out (long term hold, right?); when FTX collapsed, many of my friends were panicking, pulling money out, etc. I honestly didn’t think twice about dropping Coinbase!  I even use their Wallet App to hold and/or Stake assets. 
My research of Coinbase, again after FTX, showed I don’t have “a lot” to worry about. 
Their stock sure took a beating since the early days and the highs (I was purely lucky when I sold at 300s). However, balance sheet, financial statements , assets and Most Important - their “Coin” - the USDC, is (again) Stable and supported just enough for my comfort. 
Today, I needed to liquidate some of my assets, for a major transaction, and the App, UI, Flow, Options, Large Offering and speed of both, transfers, sales and sending money out to banks and financial institutions; I am very pleased and continue to have, again, “Just Enough” confidence in Coinbase as a company that I will continue to be a client and even probably, recommend it to friends, family and anyone who reads this review — With the Disclaimer — Do your own homework."

The people have no solutions for any of your problems, basically they just tell you to wait and hopefully it will fix itself. I transferred $400 from my bank account to my coin base account, And he says I’m ready for trading, I made a $100 tradeOne day and then when I tried to trade the other $300 the next day Coinbase said that I could not make the transaction because I was on able to get the money from my bank account which was just sitting there for the taking and it cost me a week and a half of training and I missed the drop on ETH. The coin base app told me to make a payment to correct the problem but the app kept saying it was having connection problems, and then two days later CoinbaseEmailed me a message, telling me they what’s going to take $400 From my crypto. So I called customer service and they have no clue on what to do. My wife had to do it from her phone to make the payment it went through, but I took another week before my account was in good standings, and by that time the market shot back up meaning I lost money for nothing."
coinbase,ios,Sexy boys 28,5,2024-01-27 08:32:04,"Coinbase is an amazing app for buying, selling, and managing cryptocurrencies. It has a sleek design, a user-friendly interface, and a variety of features that make it easy to navigate the crypto world. I love how I can track the prices of different coins, set up recurring purchases, and earn rewards by learning about new projects.

However, there is one thing that I think Coinbase should improve on: the user interface for iPad Pro tablet/keyboard. I use my iPad Pro as my main computer, and I find that the app does not fit well on the screen. The interface is the wrong aspect ratio, so there is a lot of blank space on the sides. This makes the app look less appealing and wastes valuable screen real estate. I wish Coinbase would optimize the app for iPad Pro users, and make it more responsive and adaptive to different screen sizes and orientations.

Overall, I think Coinbase is a great app for crypto enthusiasts, but it could be even better with some tweaks to the iPad Pro interface. I hope the developers will take this feedback into account and update the app soon."
coinbase,ios,Mfrielin,1,2021-01-16 19:46:05,"There are many things I like about Coinbase. Easy and intuitive interface, easy of trading between currencies, etc. But as I got more savvy in my trading and started tracking gains, I’ve found discrepancies between increases in currency rates and my balance. In other words, I would track the time in which I had made trades and calculate the amount that my balance should reflect. I found almost always that it was off and not by a little, by a lot. This is alarming to me as I see that there is real potential for fraud within this platform. In addition, I’d sent a transfer of funds from MY Binance account to my Coinbase account and after a week, I have yet to see those funds deposit to my ETC wallet that I’d used for the transfer. I’ve sent multiple customer service requests since then regarding the transfer both to Binance and to Coinbase. Binance has gotten back to me sharing the blockchain record of my transfer to my ETC Coinbase account indicating that I would need to remedy account receipts with Coinbase. I reached out to Coinbase and then have yet to respond. This was not a small amount. It is not okay for them to have inaccurate gains reflecting in account balances and no response on transactions that should have cleared over a week ago now. 

I will be filing a complaint with SEC outlining these discrepancies and their failure to remedy them."
coinbase,ios,Jay'sCraft,1,2022-04-04 10:02:47,"They 100% screw you over with fees. It costs 1.99$ to buy any type of cryptocurrency. If you want to trade one currency to another it costs $.99, and if you want to transfer it back to your bank account it costs another $1.99. So I have to pick the right currency, make sure it goes up at least $3.99 up in profit just to make any money? Which is very unlikely, because apps like these are designed to screw over the little people that want get into buying and selling crypto. I understand that the company has to make money some how, but charging every single transaction a bunch of money isn’t even fair. I was offered in app $1 in a crypto currency. Want to know how much it cost me to transfer it to any type of coin that made money? $.99. They offer you free crypto that is stagnant in price, to make you pay money to transfer it to other cyrptos. It’s so rigged. Do yourself a favor, and save your money instead of investing in this app. You’re basically throwing your money away if you buy anything on here.

Update: Tried cashing out because my stocks I invested in were up big time, app wouldn’t let me. Kept saying servers were down. And then because I was up so much (like $10 more) it charged me additional fees so I only ended up making $1. Are you serious Coinbase?! You have serious issues with fees. Stop charging so much."
coinbase,ios,josemerc,2,2022-09-03 05:13:03,"I love the app, it’s a bit slow for whatever reason even on the IPhone 11 Pro Max. However my main concern are the notifications and transaction fees for coinbase. I’ve always been stuck using 3rd party alerts for my coins as well as 3rd party decentralized platforms that have .10c fees per every transaction meanwhile I lose $3-$5 per transaction even for converting one to another. Throughout the many years of using coinbase the notifications have never worked accordingly or at all, I’m not just talking about the actual notifications but when you receive movement notifications they’re extremely behind. I won’t receive important alerts or notifications but then sometimes it will send me a notification every other hour, especially when there’s a lot of movement in the market. Just seems a little odd and slow for such a large company. coinbase vs literally what I use everyday will always be the last app to notify me accordingly of anything important. If we can also have an option to remove the “your USDC funds are low”. I don’t want to be told to fill my balance when I’m already planning on purchasing more just not right when the app tells me to This app gets more and more awful as it updates. 80% of it is a scam"
coinbase,ios,Giseii,1,2022-01-17 22:03:25,"I’ve been using and a fan of Coinbase for a long time but as of late it’s just really hard for me to recommend. You don’t actually technically speaking “own” any of your crypto, but that’s not my main issue. Lately I’ve put a lot and I mean A LOT of money into buying this most recent dip, had no problems until I decided to log on and found I wasn’t able to send any of my crypto. Over the next week, I lost the ability to cash out, sell do anything. Not a problem? I logged in, I have been asked to verify my identity 3 times and even then still my situation hasn’t improved. I later found a notification in my account that I owed them like $100? Weird but okay fine, I paid it. It took over a week for that to finally be cleared from my account but it took the money from my bank so I figured all was good, went back on and was asked to verify my identity AGAIN. Limits hadn’t been removed, still couldn’t send or anything. It’s impossible to get ahold of support, even with the live chat youre sat waiting there for 45 minutes for them to type a response and when they do it’s the same copy paste crap, customer support is completely unresponsive and impossible to get a hold of. So now I’m left with $1000 sitting in an account that I can do nothing on, do yourself a favor and go somewhere else."
coinbase,ios,Psyloh,2,2022-03-19 23:34:05,"I have been buying LRC on Coinbase for a couple months now, and I can’t believe it took me so long to notice, but they run the same scam that Robinhood runs with their crypto, except RH doesn’t charge a Transaction fee each time. Pay attention when you go to a coin. They show you the list price, but when you review your purchase before submitting it, they actually charge you a higher price/coin on top of their transaction fee. It’s the same thing with selling. They give you a lower rate than the listed price, as well as charging you transaction fees. They’re scalping customers, exactly the same way RH does by giving you, “the customer” a .03 cent spread. Even with the “Coinbase One” membership, this is still true.

If you can learn more complicated methods of trading crypto, I suggest that over this. If not, I hope you don’t mind getting scalped. The GOOD thing about Coinbase is that you can actually transfer your coins to different wallets, which shows they do actually have coins to give you should you actually request them sent to your wallet.

Response to Developers Response: This isn’t 2020. With everything that happened in 2021, investors are becoming wiser to things like Spread, PFOF, and the conflicts of interest in brokers and Wall St. in general."
coinbase,ios,SabinVI,1,2021-11-10 21:21:52,"The latest update to the Coinbase app has decreased functionality. Users like me want a snapshot of all their crypto investments on the homepage. This means to see their overall portfolio balance as well as all the coins on their watchlist. A quick overview with no further clicks. This is how it used to be. Now, in the latest version, the watchlist is limited to 5 items. If you want to see the rest of your items, you have to click into another screen. Horrible UI. It may seem small, but I check my investments multiple times per day. It used to be one simple click to open Coinbase, see my favorite coins, and done. Now every single time I open the app I have to click into multiple screens to see everything I want to see. Very annoying! Please fix this “upgrade” and bring back the old homepage with full watchlist functionality. Or better yet, let users create multiple watchlists like Robinhood where you can organize them better and maybe we can choose if we want them on the homepage or not. Removing a feature that your users have had for years is not a smart business decision. Robinhood shows all investments on the homepage and that’s why everyone always compliments their UI. I hope Coinbase can bring back what was the equivalent in the crypto world."
coinbase,ios,Tim.T2,1,2022-04-18 20:58:38,"DO NOT USE COINBASE! Coinbase is basically a company of scammers that have come together to steal crypto from their customers. Look at all the real peoples reviews with reports of missing crypto and poor support. Their support is garbage their technicians don’t know what they’re talking about and refuse to help for simple things even when it’s clearly stated in Coinbases own policy. When you send facts and evidence they stop replying. Even the $5 free bitcoin promotion that is still shown here you won’t get it and they won’t help you or care after you make an account. If you decide to use Coinbase expect nothing but headaches transfers will go missing, any promotional bonuses or offers are fake you won’t really get them, if you contact support they will send you links to their support page that show what you contacted for and need help with is within their policy but then they just stop replying or make up bogus reasons of why they can’t help. It’s amazing this company is still able to operate when they break so many basic laws about false advertising and consistently screw over their customers. I pray Coinbase gets shut down or at least heavily audited everything will quickly fall if they’re forced to take responsibility for their claims, actions, and publicity published policies."
coinbase,ios,A Small Investor,5,2024-02-19 00:50:43,"Coinbase has been a game-changer for me when it comes to managing and growing my digital assets. What I appreciate the most is its user-friendly interface, making it incredibly easy for both beginners and seasoned investors to navigate through the platform. The interest rates offered by Coinbase are very competitive, which is a big plus for anyone looking to earn on their cryptocurrency holdings. Without a doubt, it has enabled me to make decent passive income—nothing to brag about, but certainly a noteworthy addition to my financial portfolio.

Moreover, if you're like me, searching for additional avenues to increase your bank value, especially if you have cash just sitting in the bank, I highly recommend considering Coinbase. It's not just about trading cryptocurrencies; the platform offers various ways to earn interest on your holdings, which can be a smart move for long-term financial growth. My experience with Coinbase has been positive overall, and I believe it's a solid choice for anyone looking to explore the potential of cryptocurrency investments."
coinbase,ios,tonemccone,1,2023-03-17 00:44:13,"Updating from two to one star for the canned response they left on this review, which indicates they didn’t read it. Of course the funds aren’t available right away, but they shouldn’t continue to be held after the transaction clears with my bank. 7 full days is so arbitrarily long.

Original review:

Even after a transaction to buy crypto clears with your bank, they call it “pending” so they can hold it for the full 7 days. Any time a bank doesn’t let you access your own funds, it’s either security or it’s because they want to make money off your money. The longer it’s with them, the more they can make. Then, when you do want to move some money, they charge you super high fees to do it. Crypto is such a friggin’ scam. Not as bad as NFT’s, but still … it’s going to be a long time before crypto is actually worth it to most people, which is why it’s also so volatile and even a huge group of celebrities and investors can get scammed out of millions, like with FTX. Coinbase is just another company making money hand over fist without providing good support to customers or offering decent fees. They’re not FTX, but they’re profiting majorly off an unstable system without providing good support along the way, and charging an arm and a leg for their good enough services."
coinbase,ios,heddiepoo,1,2021-03-30 20:01:58,"I hate giving this rating given the fact that Coinbase has been my go to wallet but as of the last couple months it’s been absolutely HORRIBLE. When I ask to raise my limits from 50 dollar card purchases it somehow instead of being increased got lowered to $5.00. I emailed support over a month ago and they gave me a generic response saying that it was being sent up to review and would have someone email me back. This was a month ago and I am still waiting on that email. So ok that’s just a slight inconvenience because I can always just make a purchase with my bank account. WRONG every attempt made gets turned down due to “suspicious activity” which only gets worse because of the fact that this happened on not 1 but all 3 of my bank accounts connected. So once again I have to contact support. This time I try to call to actually speak to someone since they are unwilling to respond to support via email. What do you know, I run into another issue. Coinbase no longer has telephone support anymore. That’s only reserved for compromised accounts. So that’s great I have to email yet again... Here we are now and since I have been waiting to make this purchase BTC has only risen by about 15-20k or more. So thank you Coinbase for being absolutely worthless as of late."

I have however been having a few issues with the site some of the issues are you are unable to purchase certain cryptocurrency‘s I’m not sure why this is but it is very frustrating when you want to buy something and you can’t. I also purchased an asset I was told that it would be untradable after January 20, 2021 but if I had any of the asset remaining in your portfolio you would still be able to sell it , this is not the case. I’ve tried several times to rectify the situation but I’ve been unsuccessful. Sadly the only way to communicate with coin base is through text so it is very difficult to get your point across or for them to discuss something with you , it would be much better and a big improvement if you could communicate with an individual so you can express yourself and get situations handled much easier.

They will charge you fees that you don’t even know about, and they will hold your money without any response to you. Their costumer service does not have a phone line and will respond to your emails or requests in only a few weeks after you submit a case. I have deposited funds and it’s been 3 weeks and I still can’t trade them, nor I can send them or withdraw like their policy says that you funds a  re w available immediately or in few days depending on how you make your deposit. I opened a dozen cases and and only response I got it is it’s on hold for security reasons after 2 weeks of submitting my case. Complete scam ladies and gentle man, I suggest you get a paid platform and trade with confidence because here that is not possible. Even their fees are hidden. I bought a BTC partially, actual BTC price was $11,300... but when you already buy it buys it for $11,450 even though the price of BTC didn’t even go near $11,400 that day. I opened 3 cases about a month back and no one responded yet. Guys don’t waste your time and patience. Find a better platform that is paid but you will be taken care off.

When i would choose the buy button for a cyrpto currency it would bring up the normal options but wouldn’t give me any option of choosing my payment type and would give me and error. i kept trying to explain this over and over to the man but he kept giving me the same response that my account was on hold and proceeded to get rude and agrivated with me. i was just trying to resolve the issue because i had a chance to buy into a good opportunity that i knew would make me some money. i told him i didn’t understand why he was getting frustrated with me and then also proceeded to stop talking on the phone after the comment and hung up.

Bought bitcoin with the intention of selling it a few days later for a (tiny) profit as more of an experiment than anything. I sent in my license photos, linked my bank account, and got everything verified. Bought a couple hundred in btc. A few days later the price has gone up a few hundred and I try to sell- to find my funds placed on a ‘24 day hold’ to ‘prevent fraud’. What?? If this is common practice, they certainly went out of their way not to mention it, and if it isn’t, I can’t think of any reason why they would have flagged me or my transaction as suspicious. I have now sat and watched the btc price plummet over $1,000 in the past few weeks. By the time I’m able to access my money I will have lost much of it. I understand that btc prices are famously erratic and I accept that I would have lost a little bit, but with every day I lose more and more of MY money which is being held from me. Incredibly disappointed with the lack of clarity in this matter. If it were not for this ridiculous, month-long freeze on my transaction, I would be very happy with this app. The layout is nice and the verification was fast and professional.

Shortly afterwards I received an email verifying all of the information, the amount and the wallet address and informing me that for “Security Reasons” there would be a 3 day hold on my transaction and that on November 27th, at 3:00 pm pacific time, my transfer would be completed. There was a link to verify my 5 year old account. If I completed this process, the wait would be cancelled. It required me to submit photos of both sides of my Drivers License and a selfie. Well, after several attempts, it didn’t like my selfie and said I needed to wait 24 hours before I could try again. This time it seemed to like it and said my account was “VERIFIED “ No transfer took place! When November 27th, 3:00 pm pacific time arrived ( yesterday ) no transaction took place. My account balance is $1600 less than it was and I have had no other communication from them. When I go to the “pay” tab at the bottom right and scroll down, it shows the transaction as completed 3 days ago. No record of the money still being at Coinbase, no money at the transfer destination. Your fees are insane and communication is horrible!  
WHERE IS MY MONEY??
As soon as possible, I will be removing the rest of my money from Coinbase to never look back."
coinbase,ios,Pismo123,1,2020-10-31 05:21:16,"There is absolutely zero customer support with coinbase. I’ve been trying for 2 days to reach an actual human about why my money is being held captive. I made a debit card purchase which is supposed to be instant. And it said there’s a 5 day hold on my funds. So after 2 days of trying to figure out why that is, I finally just gave up and sold the btc expecting to be able to withdraw my remaining cash balance. And I lost $10 in this process, over coinbase fees, and I didn’t even care. I just wanted my money back. But now there is a hold on my cash balance too! And I needed that money yesterday. I can’t afford to wait 5 days. But coinbase doesn’t care in the slightest. Because there is no way to reach anybody for customer support. You can email them, but you will just get a robotic response saying it will take 5-7+ days to fix your issue. So I’m pretty positive that nobody even actually reads the customer support emails. And now my only money is being held captive by this website that won’t even give me the time of day to tell me why. I’m extremely frustrated. This app is the worst btc app I’ve ever used, because this isn’t the first time I’ve had issues like this where “customer support” did absolutely nothing for me. Never coming back to coinbase after they finally stop holding my money captive."
coinbase,ios,Needs to be on Xbox or ps3,1,2020-10-20 05:24:20,I’ve been dealing with Coinbase Support for 6 weeks now and my issue still has not been resolved. You can only contact via email which takes days for them to reply and most times its a automated response. Once you actually get a real response its often vague and instructions that are already listed on their website. If you’re having issues with staking certain crypto currencies then good luck on getting them fixed because I am still unable to stake. They claim my account is unverified but yet I have went through the verification process numerous times and even have level 3 (highest level) verification on my account. I have tried contacting on social media and have gotten nowhere. I have tried callihg but can’t even get to speak to a person because they only will deal with account compromises over the phone which is a total load of crap. I would not recommend coinbase solely because their support services are atrocious. you are likely to have an issue when encountering this platform and will need their help at some point. I have friends who have had similar experiences in the past with different issues and experienced the same level of aggravation for coinbase support.
coinbase,ios,DanielleR78,5,2021-04-26 11:52:53,"I currently use cashapp for my Bitcoin but I was curious to see what other apps there were for crypto.I read on the internet that Coinbase was great for buying and selling. So I did download it but before I signed up I went back and started reading the reviews from people who have downloaded it and have been using it. Let me just say that I can’t remember ever seeing an app with so many horribly bad reviews! Out of all the ones that I ran there was only one that was an OK review not even a good one just an OK but all the other ones were bad really bad. People are getting money taken from their bank accounts without initiating it or authorizing it people were being locked out of their accounts and then nobody from Coinbase is answering anything no emails no nothing no one‘s doing anything about it so if anyone read this I would stay away from Coinbase I’m definitely deleting it right now, I am not putting any of my information in there! I’ll stick with Cashapp and PayPal I know I can trust them."
coinbase,ios,OnceBurnedTwiceShy,1,2022-04-26 18:59:33,"I’ve been using Coinbase for several years and though it wasn’t perfect the app filled most of my needs. I didn’t even mind that they charge higher than average fees.
I recently took a couple months off trading but woke up one morning to a call from my bank that Coinbase was attempting to withdraw $5,000 from my account. An action I certainly did not initiate as I was well aware I had less than $10 in the bank.
I contacted Coinbase immediately and notified them that my account had been hacked. Yet somehow they had instantly credited my crypto account for the $5,000 and then allowed it to be sent somewhere. Now I have never been able to send or withdraw funds until they cleared the bank but I guess the hacker just had the special touch.
Two months went by and I still hadn’t heard from Coinbase, so I reached out to them again. At which time they inform me that my account is locked until I pay for the missing funds! Their reasoning is that I somehow allowed my account to be hacked. Well the way I see it the most logical explanation given the turn of events is that it was hacked from within Coinbase itself. Anyhow they can keep the account locked because they won’t be seeing me or getting my business again."
coinbase,ios,Bairex12,1,2021-11-25 11:47:32,"I would give no stars if possible. Coinbase are scammers. They clearly have an agenda and it isn’t a good one. They had a glitch with the GYEN coin and mind you THEY HAD A GLITCH. Then they decided they wanted to penalize everyone that purchased or cash out when that glitch happened. Mind you I didn’t know it was a glitch so I was extremely happy that this coin made me some money. Then the nightmare began. Coinbase drained all of my account without no warning  saying I owed them money when it was their fault. I had other coins also not just this one which is extremely frustrating. Then they proceeded to change the history of my transactions which by the way I have screenshots of the original transactions. They are on some shady shady business and I have already lawyered up. Coinbase will not win this battle it doesn’t matter how long I have to fight I will fight for how many ever years they drag this out . Coinbase should just take their loss and continue to do business because I know for a fact I am not the only one going thru this. Coinbase do the right thing and GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK AND MY ACCOUNT. To those who haven’t yet downloaded this app STAYYYYY AWAYYYYYYY there are many other cryto trading platforms and wallets that are not this shady, money hungry, and unfair."
coinbase,ios,Mommyfreez,5,2023-11-10 22:46:53,"I gave this app 5 star just because it deserves it, I mean if you talking about customer support they are always fast and good at what they do, security so good, buys and sells doesn’t have no issue. But the main problem I have with this whole thing is LIMIT of buys” if you give a customer 250 as limit just leave it as 250 until you see its worth it to increase the limit, why decreasing limit just because a card is added or card is deleted? I mean I hate this like it’s very annoying! Someone’s on 750 limit for buying crypto, because he/she is unable to buy for a week or buys lower than that amount Coinbase set for the account, they quickly reduce it. That’s very bad honestly and it needs to be addressed! Please leave the limit once you’ve increased it, you guys can wait for as long as you want the person to trade before you increase the limit for the profile if it’s worth it, but decreasing is very bad and makes someone wants to try another app. Dang it!"
coinbase,ios,MD drawer,1,2021-10-27 22:09:23,"Coinbase is a fee-based software that allows regular individuals to invest their hard-earned cash in cryptocurrency. Coinbase, unlike other apps, charges a high fee for clients to store and secure funds in Coinbase crypto wallets. You'll also pay a market buy/sell price that's substantially more than the actual price of the coin you're buying. For example, if you buy a $1000 coin with $1000 in cash, you will receive about $900 of the coin you just bought. Coinbase charges you a high fee for holding and securing your cryptocurrency once you're ready to sell (regardless if it was for a minute or a year). Furthermore, you will receive a market buy/sell price that is far lower than the actual price of the coin you are selling. For example, if you sell the same crypto you just bought for $1000 and only got $900 in crypto, you'll earn roughly $800 in fiat. This is robbery in broad daylight, in my opinion. 

When you trade or exchange Cryptos with other Cryptos, it gets even worse. Because there is no easy way to contact these crooks, their customer service is non-existent. I hope they put an end to this open-air robbery and consider hardworking individuals like me who have lost a lot of money due to the fees these people charge."
coinbase,ios,user 11236,1,2021-02-15 03:39:03,"I told you guys about an erroneous transaction immediately when it happened on February 1. Now you are kicking me off the system after you forced me to RE-verify all of my information leading me to believe I would be good. I could have been started to withdraw my money now I have to wait an additional 10 more days. When I told you guys about this erroneous transaction I was told in an email also on February 1 from you that “ If you do not have enough funds in your bank account to cover this purchase, then allow the transaction to reverse and reprocess with your bank. If we’re unable to successfully complete the transaction with your bank, we will attempt to recover the value of your funds held onsite.” I left the money there didn’t trade any additional stock with it waited for you guys. When I found out I couldn’t make any more transactions they gave me an option to give it back. This option was not told to me in the email. You can check. I immediately gave it back when I seen that option so why am I being penalized? I even took the money out of the stock in the event it dropped I didn’t want your money to be affected. To kick me off the site after dragging me along an entire 14 days with almost 2k tied up is pretty ridiculous."
coinbase,ios,davidjpfeiffer,1,2020-05-03 01:25:24,"I downloaded this app to start investing in bitcoin, and I spent a few days setting it up. I even made one test purchase, which was successful, just to make sure I would be ready to buy when the price was low. When that time came, I attempted to buy a much larger amount. I had plenty of funds in my bank account, but every time I attempted to make a purchase the app claimed that there were no funds. I contacted my bank and they said that no one had even attempted any transactions. It was clearly a bug on their end, and when I reported it, they disabled buying on my account completely. I was unable to buy any amount of bitcoin, despite having thousands of dollars ready to transfer from my bank account. I had to sit and watch as the price of bitcoin soared, unable to buy any with the app I had spent several days setting up. As I watched the price soar, the only response I could get from customer service (which is only available via email) was that I “needed to have enough funds in my bank account”.

The app has tons of bugs. The fees are high. The customer service is trash. I missed out on a great investment opportunity because of software bugs in this app. Don’t make the same mistake as me, find a different way to invest in bitcoin."

The live chat is only an AI that can’t help with anything if it’s not basic. And yeah, there’s no phone number or no way to get a hold of a real person. So then your money is just stuck in limbo. I suggest not investing or using this app. and I find it funny that a lot of people have similar or same complaint yet for some reason there says five star review and under that five stars they’re complaining about the app."

Due to personal reasons I unexpectedly had to change my phone number and email, and since I forgot my password I have no way of verifying my account. I have been attempting to reach support for over three months now in order to gain access to my old account. I’ve entered three separate cases, each time referring to the previous case number to which I inform no one ever answered. I was told on the last two attempts that someone would review my case and get back to me. The very last time I was told that because I reached out several times about the same issue (even thought THEY never answered. The tone read very condescending) it would be consolidated into one email thread and that I would hear from someone in 4-5 business days. That was 16 business days ago. I emailed back ONCE AGAIN this past Friday and now Monday have still not gotten a response. This is the most infuriating experience and I agree with other users it’s negligent and criminal to give individuals no way of speaking to someone in person and making it impossible to access one’s own funds. I would never recommend Coinbase now based on this experience."

Now it’s been hours and I don’t think I am ever going to get my money. After trying on multiple devices and payment methods, they won’t let go of my money.

On Monday morning my balance in cb was $170, my balance in my web3 wallet was $70; at night the balance was $111 and $0 respectively with no transactions, and no movement in my holdings. I thought someone had gotten into my account but my transactions didn’t show it, and I noticed retroactively the amounts (1 week change) were lower. I started a chat with customer service. The real (I guess?) rep told me to check my transactions, and I told them to look at the individual balances (bitcoin, eth) which did equal $170. They did not seem to get what i was saying which is the app appeared to lose my money. They told me they’d have an email tech reach out to me (never happened). 

On Tuesday I opened the app again and my balances fluctuated between 111 and 170 (like in real time, it was going up and down); then my web3 balance went from 0 to 59. I screen shot. 

It’s just a few hundred bucks; but I’ve had thousands in here and I wouldn’t again: I’m withdrawing my funds. I get it; they did a software update. What’s wild and shocking is how totally unaccountable they were about it and ill equipped to manage my “hey you lost my money help” inquiry. Scammy vibe."
coinbase,ios,Ditalian,1,2017-11-19 14:25:49,"I started with coinbase and was charged excessively for buying BTC ETC LTC. They feed on newbies entering the market and charge ridiculous fees per buy or sell. It’s called taking that initial hit because you pay for the convenience. Put your money on coinbase and transfer it directly to GDAX(also owned by coinbase) 

This is an easy way to get into the cryptocurrency, but for the uninitiated it is not a trading platform. GDAX is. You can fund your COINBASE account, but they neglect to tell you that you can make a GDAX account and transfer your money free of charge and buy/sell/trade for minimum fees. Limit buys and sells are free on GDAX. The pros: COINBASE is legit and GDAX is legit. They are FDIC protected and your legal tender is insured by the federal government because it’s held in an escrow account in a bank. Your coins are insured by insurance policies. BUT It would be nice to be informed ahead of time that you can incur substantially higher fees using the simplified ap and that if your going to be trading short or long term, that transferring your funds to GDAX (an actual exchange) results in much lower fees and free limit orders. 

I’m quite happy with GDAX and my only issue is the taking advantage of newbies entering this volatile market without the foreknowledge that there sister company offers extremely lower rates."

Coinbase didn’t want take my money. After multiple attempts at trying to buy I was told I have insufficient funds. Every time!!! I go and check my back account and everything is fine I have the funds. For some reason it didn’t let me buy anything that day. This is not how it works I choose the days I want to invest and how much. I didn’t surpass any limit of any kind, and I had the latest version downloaded. Even my Mac version didn’t let me invest. I decided to open up an account on other crypto investing platform. I honestly don’t have time for this. It’s ridiculous and I’m still heated. I just want to know what happen to my first review? Was it deleted? 

Also the most sketchy part about this platform is the TRANSACTION PRICES weren’t adding up. I started documenting every time it doesn’t add up. Which isn’t hard since Coinbase makes it easy to access it. Just because Coinbase gave me free crypto doesn’t it works the other way around."
coinbase,ios,Djohnson2378910,1,2022-02-22 20:03:22,"Lol I love how you contact me on here instead of helping when I contact your customer service.  They didnt open a case they told me the 10 DAY WAIT PERIOD IS YOUR POLICY AND THEN CLOSED THE CHAT.  GARBAGE COMPANY ANY OTHER Crypto exchange is better.  DO NOT USE.  They advertise you can send things LTC instantly after purchase and then after you buy they tell you it cant be sent for 10 days.  Customer service is only staffed by mentally handicapped losers....Ive submitted 3 tickets for my ether purchase not showing up even though I have the email confirming the purchase and the money has left my bank.  I gave you the reference number the date and amount and you close the ticket each time with the same canned response of not finding the transaction, obviously customer service isnt reading the tickets they are just closing them out so they can look like they are actually helping people.  I put in my 4th request for my purchase to be posted today and I bought this back on April 21, you are pathetically bad at this and the only reason people use you is because of marketing.  You are MySpace of crypto, post my transaction so I can transfer it out and never deal with you losers again."
coinbase,ios,jang Abadi,4,2017-12-03 04:11:32,"Coinbase is great. However, it takes 4-7 days for your transactions to clear when using your bank account, or linking your bank account. Even though im not planning on selling anytime soon, it shouldnt take so long for my purchases to be approved and show up in my wallet or portfolio. Also, they recommend using or linking your bank account, instead of using your debit card which is immediate and doesnt take 4-7 days to clear. Why does it take so long to clear? 
I understand that they want to make sure funds are in your account (i assume), but 4-7 days, is way too long. I dont think i can sell anything until everything has cleared. I also noticed that the $ was already taken out of my bank account- so why are they not available as soon as you have taken the money out of my account? The good thing i guess is that the price i purchased them at is locked in. But still would be nice if they were in my portfolio as soon as the money has been taken out of my account. All in all, this is a great, easy and fast way to buy crypto !"

Anyway I buy some ETH and only spent $1,200 and decided to pull the remaining $800 out. Then ETH dropped hard so I transferred $500 back into Coinbase and got cold feet so I didn’t buy anything, the money sat in my cash account. When it allowed me to withdraw it I took the $500 out and moved it to my bank account. 2 days later I got a message saying insufficient funds ($500) well I was going to move it back over and then let it clear and put it back into my bank again. Well they stole the money from me! They took the $500 and it disappeared. Contacted support multiple times and no responses other than “we have a specialist looking into it” and weeks go by with no responses. 

I want you to do some research on google before you give this company any money and just look at the amount of fraud claims they have against them. This company is terrible and I suggest giving your business to someone else. They refuse to help anyone with issues when they know it’s their fault!"

I got a notification from coinbase stating that my account has been locked because purchases that were made we’re unable to be funded by my locked money market account. That same day I linked another account and money was in coin base covering the two other purchases that I had made. At that point coin base told me understandably that I would be locked out of any further purchases until customer service viewed my account. It took a week for customer service to get back to me. Then out of the blue they send me an email stating that they have irreversibly block my account from any other trades or crypto purchases and that I would have to liquidate my entire account and no longer be available to use coin base. Not sure why this happened and without any explanation I thought I did everything correct besides making that first mistake.
Trust me, I have a 750 plus credit rating and cash to cover more purchases.  Coinbase’s customer service did this extreme action for in my opinion was a minor error.  You make the call."

I had no trouble opening an account. I was even able to verify that they could withdraw and deposit money in my bank account. Then for some reason I can not access my account not the funds stored within them. Customer support attempts to be helpful however it seems the issue needs to be resolved at a higher support level. Good luck with that!! I have tried and tried with no success. How can this company be trusted with your funds? Yet the tout themselves as the most secure and reliable platform. This is a LIE! If Coinbase was a responsible steward with our finances then this issue would already be resolved and my review would be a 4 or 5. As it stands it’s really a 1 but I added a star because the customer service really tries to resolve issues. A company that is riddled with errors and tries to be so secure they take your money but then won’t let you have access to it should not be trusted as a financial company nor a digital platform for managing money. I am incredibally disappointed.

Now all of a sudden if I want to withdraw any of MY money, I have to wait 18-23 days to withdraw or send anything? I called customer service and repeatedly received the scripted “we do this for security purposes” response. I tell them that the account is mine and so is the back account it’s linked to and ask what I can do to verify that the withdrawals are not fraud. She did not have a response so I asked to speak to a senior representative. Once the senior rep gets on the phone, I state my issue again. This person says “let me check on that” and then kept me on hold for over 40 minutes and counting. As I write this review I am still on hold.  It does not make sense to hold people’s money for “security purposes” but won’t allow the account holder to verify any information in order to release the funds. I’m losing hundreds/thousands of dollars because of this. As soon as my money is released I am withdrawing everything and deleting my Coinbase account.

I have been paid, recieved my funds, within the given processing time. Maybethese users did not fully verify theor accounts or maybe they used VPNs and from non-permitted countries, but also the most recent reviewers, beed to understand last week was a holiday week and this week there is new years day  so many businesses customer service will not be available and responses are delayed  This included coinbase. Also maybe read their FAQs and agreements and see what is not allowed because buying crypto not approved by them, is in a sense, not okay and it even states it in their system. So do not blame them for uour stupity. I would rather use coinbase over Blockchain whuch is way harder to ise, transfer, exchange, and most of the wallets dont work"

I’ve tried plenty of times to reach out via email, support, and even waiting for hours on the phone for someone to pick up. This is unacceptable for the customer, they will purposely not answer and have you waiting for hours on the phone so that you can just hang up eventually and not resolve your issue. Shame on you Coinbase, that’s not even the end of it. Coinbase has no actual phone number you can call, you just place a call order and the automated system will continuously repeat “thank you for calling, we care about your feedback, your call will be taken in the order it was received.

One of the things that first off I noticed they do not offer a grace period for their fees like many of the other apps will offer 30 days without fees but this app does not do that.
Also the app does not make it easy to see what’s been invested in the track your investments by cryptocurrency‘s you actually have to click into each cryptocurrency individually to see what you purchase them at and where the current values that so it’s not easy to track your overall investment portfolio performance.
Lastly there’s no a crypto wallet or earn potential within the app you have to download a different app for that and also they list all the crypto currencies but you have to sort to “tradable” because all the cryptocurrency’s that are listed are not tradeable  in this app so it’s kind of misleading until you go to the “tradable tab” and then you can see which cryptocurrency’s or actually available to be purchased through this app.

Bitcoin went down in that period, all crypto did... so conversion lost me money, they didn’t help... and I couldn’t sell it. And I had everything needed to do all those things! I was powerless to sell it during the downturn... so the essentially had control of my money for three months where I couldn’t do anything. That’s essentially stealing Coinbase... frustrating your clients enough where at one point I almost gave up and let you have my money, which makes me ask how many people have this issue... and why when I switched to the Cash App and did everything including setting up an account, sending the coin from you to them, selling the Bitcoin... why did that only take a day with them, and months with you? Money issues? Maybe"
coinbase,ios,JeffAnononomous,1,2025-02-16 13:52:20,"After completing gall lucid measures a year ago, Coinbase arbitrarily decided that I am no longer who my birth certificate says I am who the IRS says I am who all of my mini creditors say I am but of course Coinbase has to be right, correct. Not even close. Their technology is poor quality and they lack the basic ability to examine identifying documents and evaluate the sameness of two identical copies of a that document. They want you to add a correlating selfie and the ID verification, but they lack the competence to add the additional information that is required into the link that they publish all over their website. They don’t tell you that their app is substandard and is not capable of running the verification appropriately  so the website has to be used. Then they simply ghost you when they have proven overwhelming that they lack the technical ability to facilitate their own processes and lead you ton over tax their little website protocols. The sad thing is that they over promote themselves and by the time you realize they cannot deliver you have lost access to a slew of accounts and assets because Coinbase is deceptive and dishonest."
coinbase,ios,Gnostic Seeker,5,2024-03-06 19:58:16,"Consistency is key! 
I have 30% of all wallet’s available, mostly for research and testing and Coinbase stays in the top two as most reliable, secure, dependable to alert of potential problems, issues, or possible vulnerabilities or suspicious/fraudulent new crypto assets or protocols to remain aware of. There introduction of learn and earn crypto courses is good, however I believe there should be a considerable amount more invested into deeper knowledge courses perhaps integrated with mixed protocols or Dex and DeFi where crypto account holders are walked through swapping and utilization of some of the lesser known cryptocurrencies giving us more confidence when interacting with them. Of course if they are allowed on Coinbase we are assuming each one is vetted carefully and it’s fairly safe to interact with them. 

Education right now is much more valuable than any marketing campaign, because word of mouth, coupled with capable users who can teach the next person, is something you cannot buy."
coinbase,ios,JaneTrades,1,2020-08-10 17:17:51,"There is no customer service number to call if anything happens to your assets, which is a very scary thought considering mistakes happen all the time with Coinbase. For example, I purchased $500 worth of a coin as it was just beginning a massive bull run. At first, the payment went through and then a week later I checked my account and all my crypto I had purchased was gone. Turns out the “payment had failed” even though I had well over $500 in my bank account. I contacted Coinbase through email to ask them what happened and to reimburse me for my coins, telling them I’d happily provide bank statements to prove I had the funds available. They responded with NO explanation and told me I could no longer make any purchases in the app. Their mistake has so far cost me $1200 I would have made on my trade. An institution that handles personal finances absolutely MUST have a customer service line. Can you imagine if you bank misplaced your money and you couldn’t call them to fix it? I made the trade to help pay for my dog’s life saving surgery and now after all my research, analysis, and a very smart trade, I have nothing to show for it. Do yourself a favor and find another crypto brokerage to go through. Coinbase will screw you over."
coinbase,ios,chanAlia,1,2025-01-21 15:51:03,"I recently had an extremely frustrating experience with Coinbase regarding a transfer of approximately $335 from my Coinbase Wallet to my Coinbase account. Despite completing the transaction, I never received the funds in my account.

In an attempt to resolve the issue, I sought support online, only to find that helpful resources were lacking. The platform offers no immediate assistance, and getting in touch with a live representative proved to be a challenge. After waiting for nearly seven hours for a callback, I finally had the opportunity to explain my situation to a customer service representative. She requested the transaction hash to track the funds but ultimately provided no assistance, simply stating that the funds were lost.

The lack of timely and effective support, coupled with the loss of my funds without a clear resolution, has left me deeply dissatisfied with Coinbase's service. As a financial platform handling users' assets, I expected a higher standard of customer support and accountability. Unfortunately, this experience has eroded my trust in Coinbase, and I would caution others to carefully consider their options before using this platform for transactions."

Being that it was a holiday my check wasn’t deposited in time to cover a deposit I made to my account which was a trivial amount. I received the email to cover the amount, nearly the second I seen it. I attempt to use the hundreds of dollars worth of crypto I have on my account no luck, then I tried depositing money no luck. The next week I finally get to use the money I deposited it clears. And I still have no access to my account. Any other service I ever used it never took close to three weeks to make minuscule progress towards being able to move my own money. Obviously being a Coinbase one member I reach out to support 3 separate times to get absolutely no resolution. So I’m paying for a service I haven’t been able to use in three weeks , no access to my own money. Nor time table to when I can receive it.

I DID NOT INITIATE THIS TRANSFER, and it led to overdrafting my bank account since i did not have funds for a second transfer. Not only did coinbase do this, but they also froze my coinbase account and are saying that they are going to be recovering funds. When i go to my history on coinbase, it doesn’t even reflect the second transfer - and YET i’ve been getting emails about recovering funds for it, and my account has been frozen! Make it make sense. I can’t even give a reference number because there is no reflection of a second transfer when i go into the app! MAKE IT MAKE SENSE. I’m so unhappy with Coinbase.

I spent 7 hours with support trying to recover my money , and get my name change taken care of. The website tells you to upload your new id to verify your new legal name.  Was on with like 10 different agents over 7 hours. One of them told me I needed to upload my supporting court document. Which I did… they told me it was accepted. So I then was told to upload my new iD to verify my account. Which I did, they then locked me out of trying again. Which earlier they kept telling me to resubmit it. The next agents told me to resubmit my iD which some how I was able to. They still denied it, then turned around and told me I’ve tried uploading identification from two different people.  Told them to check my account and the portal for the name change decree. They kept telling me I’m two different people … they also told me I’d have to open another account if I wanted to use coinbase. Taking my access to my crypto.

coinbase,ios,Vįć,5,2021-08-26 20:42:24,"This is literally the smoothest, easiest and most non-complicated cryptocurrency app out there. As I was starting out to learn about and invest in cryptocurrency, I was suggested a few but ever since I explored Coinbase, I’m hooked. Even though I don’t afford to buy much, this app has got me in to a habit of saving and investing slowly and gradually. Its educative and very informative, means you won’t feel lost. Although they do have some popular cryptos missing and I can see how that could be a dealbreaker because it’s a missed opportunity, but for someone who’s starting out, there’s nothing like Coinbase, it LITERALLY has everything you need. By the way, I see they’re bringing more currencies on board gradually which is great! I’m really very happy with Coinbase and for anyone reading this and contemplating how you should invest in crypto and what’s the best way to do it, I’d say do it with Coinbase. You’ll love it! Thanks and keep up the great work Coinbase team 😃👍🏻"
coinbase,ios,rzvvf,1,2022-04-21 13:09:44,"This is my story, which hopefully gives you a sense of what you might have to deal with. I created an account and bought some crypto. A few hours later I noticed that my account is restricted and is flagged for manual review. What I should’ve done at that time was to dispute the charge on my credit card and cancel the transaction, but unfortunately I didn’t because I thought they have a legit business and will take care of it. So, I reached out to customer service and it took them several months to reply and then they asked me to upload a copy of my identity documents through some random website. Now, given that Coinbase website itself was hacked, why should I trust a random website introduced by Coinbase to upload my documents? So, I figured the amount of crypto I have in my account is not worth it to upload my documents through their method which is not safe (in my opinion. Obviously they think it’s safe, but I do not trust data safety comments from a company that has been hacked before) and might create a bigger headache for me in future. So, I gave up at this point; it doesn’t feel good though; I feel like my money is stolen."

I was going to use Coinbase to start investing in crypto coins.  But the coin I was looking in to at the time had a complicated presses for getting the coin through Coinbase. so I never went through this app.  Now in the last month I have had two emails saying I have requested to change my password.  I have not even been on the app for months so I was confused/concerned.  So I put the coinbase app back on my phone and logged in with no problem. Change my password and made sure there was no important information on there.  Then I get another email saying that I requested to change my password again.  So I again log in and change my password.  I try to call and talk to someone a person not a recording/prompt and they only allow me to put a ticket in.  So I guess that I will just lock the account and delete it in hopes that no one will get in and get my SS# or any other personal info.  

In short a little person to person communication would go a long way.  Or a report option on the password change request email."

And I cannot stress this enough because anytime I’ve had to use any sort of financial systems customer service, I’m usually greeted with the “there is nothing we can do sir, apologies and have a fantastic day.” Which is not what you want to hear when you’re trying to recover lost funds.

When I receive my bank statement, coinbase had actually double charged my bank account. 75 twice and 100 twice. So now I have 350 deducted from my bank and only 175 in my coinbase account. Frustrating to say the least. So I did a stop payment through my bank and got 75 and 100 back, awesome right? No, I then receive an email from coinbase saying I need to link another bank account to my coinbase account. Otherwise they will sell the crypto I have in my wallet on there app. Mind you they have already taken 350 from me, I got 175 back and they still want money from me. I plan to attempt to reverse the remaining 175 they took from my bank, and walk away. Imagine if you deposited 1000 or even 5000 in there and they double charge your account.

My account is locked for whatever reason and when I try to login on my computer I can’t verify my drivers license because I don’t have a webcam on my desktop. The fact that I can’t pick a .jpg of my drivers license from files shows how lazy this service is. They then recommend me to go on my iPhone and verify my account, to which I can’t because my account is locked. You can see the ignorant cycle here. I’ve been trying to call them for weeks but no one picks up the phone. I tried submitting a support ticket many times but they automatically close the case for not sending the ticket through a “verified” device. WHICH MAKES NO SENSE BECAUSE MY WHOLE ISSUE IS VERIFYING MY DAM* account. If I HAD A VERIFIED DEVICE I WOULDNT HAVE THIS PROBLEM AND WOULDNT NEED TO CONTACT SUPPORT. I will be contacting law enforcement to get my money out of this service because I had quite a bit invested and they have practically stolen it. Absolute trash company and garbage service.

Coinbase was my very first trusted crypto exchange…and I’m so glad I found them! Thanks to Coinbase, In less than two months I’ve learned more about investing, cryptos, blockchains, ETHs, & more than I’ve learned over the past year or so. I’m being very sincere, they really care about their customers. No I haven’t spoken with CS, but I haven’t needed to. Their mobile app and website are extremely user friendly, and new investor friendly…which was a HUGE pull for me. I honestly feel that I should be paying Coinbase for the amount of education, care, & knowledge I’ve received thus far. Keep it up, y’all! PS: You can also invest in Coinbase (which I highly advise).

Now XRP IS UP $3. Shame on coinbase for scamming people this way, as many many people have complained about this as well. Do your research and see for yourself. Not trusted at all I’d put your money elsewhere with more positive reviews and not a platform that robs you of your money just a few days before a bull run. I’m disgusted. I’ll be emailing them if I can even get to a real person since they don’t even have a phone number or direct email (that’s also really shady and unprofessional) and if no further action is taken to recover my stolen funds that have been essentially stolen from me by coinbase, I’ll have no other choice but to file a complain and a formal lawsuit."

After a standard transaction on April 23, 2024, I was blindsided by a notice of account termination without any concrete explanation. The customer support provided no specific reasons despite my adherence to all Coinbase's requirements, leaving me in a state of confusion and frustration.

I am facing the reality of being forced to withdraw my funds, diminished by transaction fees, under circumstances that have not been clearly justified. The generic responses about 'security and compliance' are not satisfactory, and my attempts to seek a detailed explanation have been unsuccessful.

This experience has compromised my trust in Coinbase, and I am compelled to escalate the issue through a chargeback process due to the lack of support and transparency. I demand a direct and detailed explanation from a senior representative and an assurance that my case will be reviewed with the seriousness it warrants. The resolution of my case should be a priority, as it speaks volumes about the respect and service a loyal customer can expect from Coinbase."

It turned out that PayPal (which works well with all my other merchants) actually declined those transactions, HOWEVER I was never notified of that issues and Coinbase DOESN’T HAVE THAT FEATURE to notify its customers is a transaction failed. After an hour and providing the supervisor with info and feedback I got no “thank you” for helping them uncover a real issue with the app and no compensation for any of my transactions which were apparently denied but never reported to me. I’m looking for a new Crypto App to switch over to.

After a few years of moderate investing and using the free Coinbase earn feature for learning about various cryptos and getting a few dollars, I’ve managed to quadruple my portfolio. I’m not a serious or experienced trader, so this app is perfect for me. My only complaint would be that the fees seem a little high when you make multiple transactions and the undercutting of the price to allow for market fluctuations always seems to be more extreme than necessary, but if you take that into account as you make your sell orders, it all kind of evens out. This app is more ideal for HODLing, but I make some trades here and there as things go up and down. I’ve tried other apps and didn’t like the UI or just didn’t trust them. For that, I choose Coinbase. Just make sure you have a wallet, not your keys, not your crypto."

I enter in the correct vale’s and nothing happens. It makes me enter the values in again and nothing happens after that. I have tried this around 30-40 times and it just flat out doesn’t work.

I will also make sure everyone I know does not use this app. I have genuinely never been more frustrated by one app. I have tried for hours and nothing works.

I deposited $3k through ACH from my bank on Feb 9th, 2021. Zero balance shown in Coinbase and Coinbase Pro ever since. Oddly, my account history in Coinbase reflects a $3k USD transfer to Coinbase Pro (which I didn’t initiate) but such transfer does not exist in my Coinbase Pro account.

I understand the heavy interest in crypto has bogged down support, which I have sympathy for. Expecting customers to sit on their hands for 30+ days without any response is unethical and morally demeaning. 

If you are reading this review to see if you should be downloading the Coinbase app, please do not do it. Look elsewhere.

The crypto industry is still emerging. Coinbase should follow the customer priority model of Gemini. When I had a customer support issue with Gemini’s new app back in 2018, not only did I get quick 2hr email response detailing the probable cause but I also received a conference call minutes later from the dev team inquiring the steps leading up to the issue so it didn’t happen to anyone else. The team literally fixed the issue with me, live on the phone within minutes and I was extremely happy to help.

coinbase,ios,11thzone,5,2021-06-02 11:53:54,"PROS:
Gives easy access to cryptocurrency trading. 
“Instant” deposits. (More on this below.)
App is user friendly and simple. 

CONS:
Gives easy access to cryptocurrency trading. 
Instant deposits allow purchases, positive cash flow is needed for high frequency trading. (Duh)
App is way too simple. Even Pro is too limited. We need far more functionality and features. Tracking data of trades etc etc. Charts need improvement. Other Apps should not rival a Billion dollar company in tracking cryptocurrency. You need better CS. Use TDA as your model, not RbnHd.
It should be more clear when funds have cleared the bank, and when cryptocurrency becomes transferable. The Portfolio should only have assets managed in list form. A ”Coin List” can show all coins available, tradable, etc, and a Watchlist are in dire need of inclusion. I also don’t understand the multiple app approach. Account privilege status should be set up in an account hierarchy that grants access to higher levels within the App, not split up into separate Apps. 

Over all great experience so far. Reliable yet limited, but does what it does well. Let your deposits clear before you transfer coin. Know the limitations and pray for updates. Still recommended highly even though this review may sound super critical. That is not the intention. Will upgrade review and star level when shown improvement."

I think the only reason I still use it is to buy coins quick to transfer to my ledger. I don’t trust them and the info they give to the government which totally defeats the purpose of crypto, their fees are kinda expensive and annoying!! They are 100% ripping you off on the APY for cryptos such as Eth ,Ada, and more  basically halving your interest amount. They crypto availability is okay but not great and a friendly reminder that if they go bankrupt your crypto is gone and they receive your money . Coinbase one is a joke and way overpriced for what it is and your money should be safe in Coinbase anyway which says a lot about them as a company and how safe your money really is . The only saving grace is their ceo (who i like a lot ) the ease of sending crypto, and the fact they are popular enough that I  doubt they go bankrupt like voyager or Celsius ( but it could happen) . Overall be vigilant about this company and just make sure when you buy your crypto to transfer it to a hard wallet if you wanna secure your crypto."

I did a lot of research before choosing Coinbase and they seemed to have the best user reviews of all the US based Bitcoin services. The setup was very easy and selling was incredibly easy. Anyone who has tried to sell Bitcoin in the past will tell you, selling the coins was not only overwhelming, but also difficult. Coinbase has changed all that. I have sold coins with both the website and the app, and surprisingly, the iPhone app is actually easier use and offers a better user experience. I would definitely recommend this app to anyone interested in buying/selling Bitcoin!

Unrelated, I would highly recommend you enable MFA (Multi Facet Authentication) which adds a second layer of authenticating when logging into the app. This helps prevent unauthorized access as Bitcoin wallets are a prime target for hackers."

I needed to make I needed make a withdrawal and send 1,200 dollars worth of assets to Nexo in order to leverage a loan. And as you would expect, the delayed it 72 hours for security purposes. That was frustrating. But then again they give you the option to accelerate your request with photo verification.... Well, even if you’re already verified, you need to verify it AGAIN just for that single request! What kind of BS is that? Well it gets worse. No matter how many times you put in your documents, it skips over the selfie option and automatically fails your attempt. 

No matter what I do, how many times I try, they fail my attempts. Fine. Fine! So after that I canceled my larger request and went with a much smaller 400 dollar withdrawal to another address. 

AND THEY FROZE IT AGAIN!! 

Tell me, what is the point of a digital economy if the platforms we trust to facilitate payments is as slow as central banking? Coinbase is no longer meeting my needs as a consumer and I will be very soon looking for another exchange that’s going to give me tools that make my job simpler and that I can trust to not screw me over and hold my funds just for the hell of it. 

If you are looking for fast and reliable, Coinbase barely cuts it..."

I swear to you I’ve been trying to withdraw my money from this app since April and when I reached out to customer service to get help they locked my account, have been ignoring me, and keep marking my issue as handled. I invested about $100 but it’s unfortunate that these people do not care who they’re doing what to. I am a single mom and literally was just trying to jump on the train of returns and it’s not even the dip that’s screwing me but the actual company. I honestly wouldn’t recommend investing in this app at all. They don’t even have customer service. And I have PLENTY of receipts. Just because of the way they are going about the situation Im not letting this go. Too many people invest in these apps and imagine if 400K of the 1.4 million who just REVIEWED the app put in $5-$250 and can’t even get their money back!!!!????? Some people even invest $1000s. So what do you do when the app is STEALING???!!! Modern day freaking robbery. And I’m not about to be quiet about it. You can REST ASSURE this company will be going in my article and the circulation is about to be insane."

I find it quite funny they where quick to go public selling stocks yet the company has 0 and when I say zero I mean zero customer support they advertise on so many platforms and if you check all their comments it’s full of people with situations exactly like mine 100% don’t recommend this app or services unless you want to give them free money as they lock your money and won’t respond about unlocking your account stating “we have larger than usual support request and may take some time to respond” it’s been a year I guess the two guys running it are just stealing money from customers and not offering any help honestly about to report them to BBB for fraud…

I contacted my bank and it is not maxed out in my account. I chatted with a virtual assistant and when that work  I chatted with 3 agents all of whom stated they complely understood my issues and would get me started. I was only buying $200 at this time. All of them sounded condescending with the completely understanding. None of them could tell me why my card was declined or maxed out. All three totally failed. Then in total frustration with your site I asked how do I close the account. The agent sent me a 4 or 5 paragraph list to close the account telling me to clean everything out. They knew I was not successful buying anything or transferring any money into the account. Th agent asked me for more verification including a picture identification. When I asked why I needed a picture identification like a passport they said it was for security purposes. But could not tell me why the card was maxed out. Obviously no one will read this and no one will care about one little client.

That’s where the whole things goes sideways, having got the account opens and verified, I transferred funds from my personal account. The funds where verified as having left my account and it took well over a week before you confirmed it as readily available to use whilst trading. Next problem, at watching the market to buy in at the right price for me and sell at the right point, Bitcoin suspends trading!. Your fees for transactions are down right insane and day light robbery. You have zero customer service and never get back to anyone. You do not have a direct number customer service number. You’re excuse for suspended trading due to high volume of trades or customer interest is a joke. If you can’t handle what you have currently, stop taking peoples money and deal effectively with what you have to hand already. Stop manipulating the market to your advantage as you’re with doubt going to have the SEC knocking on your door very shortly.

No big deal 2 other options. Scan in with another phone doesn’t work cause I ran over my phone. 3rd option send in your id sent I the same ID I sent I when I got the account a year ago. They won’t accept it. absolutely disgusting customer Service that isn’t even real it’s just some AI bot telling you a bunch of nonsense or to sign into your account to get help with a real person. I CANT SIGN IN BECAUSE THEY WOMT ACCEPT ANYTHING BUT MY EMAIL AND PASSWORD ALLL I HAVE NOR WILL THEY LET ME TALK TO A REAL PERSON. This whole ordeal has made me very depressed because I have my info and current stuff and yet I have 3k-13k sitting in a account that they won’t let me access now my only hope to get in is that they see this review and call me or something. 10/10 function and reliability but by far the worst customer service you could have because it’s not real.

I wanted to place an order but I couldn’t because the entire UI was frozen. You really need to address this issue asap. This is unacceptable. 
More importantly, I was not able to provide any feedback because you do NOT have any way for users to provide feedback. I would probably do not write this review if I was able to communicate with someone. Obviously your UI monitoring isn’t good enough to pick up issues like this. Regardless, you MUST provide a way for your users to provide feedback. By the way - that help chat you have on your site is useless. It gives you an average 1 hour wait time before you can chat with anyone, and you must be pinging that chat box every 10 minutes or something if you want to stay in waiting queue. That’s just funny.

Worst crypto app ever. Would give 0 stars if possible. Cost me to lose a lot of money by not being able to manage my crypto when the market was up. Now I have lost all my gains by not being able to sell when prices were up high. Absolutely just highway robbery and they charge you an arm and a leg for fees to move your money around if you actually can move it.

Update:  I have tried uninstalling the app, resetting my phone, logging in and out, but nothing is working.  I have now lost over $120 by not being able to sell or trade my crypto on Coinbase.  Worst off, all I get in responses is the generic “please reinstall the app” or “reset your phone”.  It took over a month to even get that response from Coinbase.  Do not use this service as all you will have is problems with absolutely no support and a company that can’t even be bothered to have a human being on a phone to help you."

AND most importantly my account in Coinbase never reflected it so that money just disappeared. It left my checking but was never received into my account.

I disputed the charge with my bank and Coinbase and was refunded the extra transfer amount. However, a few days later Coinbase sent me an email stating they were going to collect the debt to them in 15 days from my current balance (coins I had previously purchased). So I emailed them literally 7 times and opened cases which were never resolved and they didn’t help me but they still closed each case stating the issue was resolved.

They literally stole my money. I am reporting them to the better business bureau and their customer support is non existent so please refrain from using this platform.

Honestly, every other app has zero issues and before the last big update yours was great too but not anymore. It’s horrible. Do better!!!"

I am signed up to make periodic deposits/payments automatically to invest more funds via my debit card, yet I cannot make a deposit payment into my checking account? It does not really make sense that the app can take payments from me but I cannot withdraw funds. This is problematic, and makes me hesitant about investing more funds using the app, which is a shame because that is obviously what I want to do. One of the crypto-currencies supported by the app is designed to make it easier for people to send and receive money.

During app setup, the user is prompted to set up two-factor authentication via SMS (the only option available). SMS is not a secure 2FA medium. Hackers and scammers have several tools in their arsenals by which SMS messages can be intercepted, socially engineered, or faked. SIM swapping attacks are a good example of this. This exposes end users to the potential loss of their crypto-currencies, while believing they are ""secure"". As a better form of security, Coinbase should add support for both hardware (yubikey etc.) and software authenticator apps to better secure users' crypto assets. In the meantime, users should use all, or a combination of the following: Use a UNIQUE/strong password for this application (ideally generated by a password manager) that is used nowhere else. Set up a PIN or additional security with their mobile provider. Use an offline hardware device like the Ledger Nano X to store crypto currencies when not actively trading or transferring assets."

I know this because I just spent 20 minutes on the phone with customer service and they were very knowledgeable and very polite and very helpful

I do a lot of business with Fidelity. They have a completely different platform with similar sales incentives, and I strongly recommend an encourage at this point Coinbase for limit purchasing and sales

I would also recommend Fidelity, but understand that Fidelity does not have long-term existing sales and purchasing request whereas, with Coinbase, you can set up permanent purchasing, and sales limit order incentives for your accounting needs."

I tried to rectify my mistake by transferring the whole amount back to my bank account, but it would only let me do half. I assumed it was so they had time for the funds to transfer from my bank to theirs so I waited a couple of business days and tried again. No luck. So now it has been 11 days and they still won’t release the funds so I can transfer it back to my bank account. I have no idea why they need to hold my money this long. I am sure it has long been deposited into their account because my account was debited 11 days ago. I am very frustrated that they are preventing me from getting money back that belongs to me. I wrote their CS department on about 5 separate occasions and get the same run around each time. I wanted to give them a chance to make things right before going this route.

coinbase,ios,Kevin_NYC resident,1,2020-12-08 16:23:00,If you want to entrust investing in an crypto app that has absolutely zero support when issues go wrong then Coinbase is the place to go. Since the world of investing in crypto is new there can be growing pains. I mistakingly sent a transaction to an email address instead of a wallet and attempts to get corrected are abysmal. The FAQ’s say if a mistake was made wait 30 days for a reversal and if still not rectified contact support. There’s the rub...You have to email support and finding the right tree structure for this type of problem was difficult. Post submitting my email I got a resolution reply from Coinbase noting my ticket was closed. 2 more attempts to get corrected through this email channel available all resulted in the same automatic closing of my ticket. I assume they auto close without a human ever even reading and reaching out to me to resolve. No way to resolve my issue and if you try to call the posted 888 number they only will let you speak to a live person if you think you have a security breach. The regulators hopefully will review their practices but until they evolve stay away.

I mean little. Just recently got a wild hair and decided to invest in some bitcoin. Which in turn started me investing, very little once again, in other crypto currency. I have almost doubled what I have put into it in just a few short months. Recently the app has been crashing, like today, a lot. When I press on anything in the app, it shuts the app down. So I can’t make any trades.  I really hope this gets fixed....soon! But so far so good...

It’s been weeks, I still am locked out with no answers. I’ve submitted an official complaint via the Coinbase website but still haven’t heard anything. I even reached out to u/coinbasesupport via Reddit, they didn’t respond to me either. Zero stars simply because of customer service. I have a big bag of crypto sitting on a locked Coinbase account, with no one to talk with or contact about it. It’s sickening. I have zero control of what’s going on. I plan to take legal action if they continue to ignore my official complaint since there is a time frame that they are obliged to respond by. Seems like they are overwhelmed with support cases and have no way to actually get to all of them. 
Anyways, the answer to all this could easily be to NOT lock ppl out as a first response. And then not communicate for weeks. Seems like common sense to me. I hate this."
coinbase,ios,vladdzi,1,2021-06-24 04:28:43,"By the time I created a profile and purchased some crypto on Coinbase I already had been investing on other two platforms so I knew exactly what I was expecting. Coinbase just seems as such amateur work comparing to the first two. First of all, I transferred money from my bank account twice. The history of my transfers  suggested the same, yet my Coinbase portfolio was higher for the amount of $130. The same amount was showing being transferred on my bank account. I am 100% positive that I never initiated that amount. It took about two weeks for the amount to become available so I could transfer it back to my bank. That was strange and I guess it will remain mystery. Secondly, it doesn’t show clear (or not at all actually) how much we are in gain or loss for each crypto we own. Also, when we go to “profile” page, it shows cryptos that we don’t own. It’s just disappointing all around. I guess now I’m stuck with it as I don’t wanna be selling my crypto, especially not now when it all crashed, but I am not happy with this app at all."

2. It doesn’t take 7 days to verify assets. 
3. Above makes web3 a frustrating experience because fees on transactions alone will render your web3 wallet useless for a week unless your asset value exceeds your deposit amount and only then can you only make a purchase for the difference. 
4. If you’re going to have dapp support, considering all the other little lessons you give people, I think it would be beneficial for others if you could explain gas fees and what swaps will potentially require in your wallet. Considering the cost of etherium and popularity on defi coins i can only imagine how many inquiries you get from your customers as to why they can’t swap $2300 worth of assets or why $150 was burned in etherium for a $85 swap. Not your responsibility but save people from learning the hard way. Just a thought"
coinbase,ios,Sorce of corse,2,2020-04-20 08:19:01,"I’ve been using Coinbase for over a month and have made a number of trades.  Reading some of the reviews prompted this one.  Where exactly is all the money from the high fees going if the company hasn’t even bothered setting up a proper customer service channel??  I haven’t personally had any issues with the UI of the app but I have also not tried to withdraw funds from the app (and will be upset if I’m charged a fee to have to wait two weeks to have access to my money) so I can’t comment on that.  

What I can comment on is the high fees for sub par service.  Because I am wondering what exactly those fees are paying for.  The charts and info available are very limited and the prices when you go to buy, sell, and I’m wanting to say even convert raises an eyebrow on occasion.  

I wasn’t planning on withdrawing my money from Coinbase for the foreseeable future, but after using it for a month, I will be looking into better options and take it from there.  But yeah, it’s pretty bad that Coinbase doesn’t have some kind of call center for customer service."

I’ve written to customer support, but they referred me to a help article, which provided basic instructions on submitting an ID. Clearly, submitting an ID is not an issue, when your stupid system doesn’t recognize it. What’s annoying, it took Coinbase about a week to come back to me with this canned response; you would think one week would be enough to come up with a personalized response with details as to why the system can’t recognize my ID. I always thought Fidelity was a crappy broker - until I started using your service - you have the crappiest app / website and customer service on the street.

I have probably spoken to 20 of their support team members to even get to this point. No one from Coinbase has reached out or even seems to care about their system essentially stealing money from me aside from the copy pasta support team messages. I would say beware and if you have any issues just be ready for them to put any burden on you even if it is caused by their faults. 

They are not a reputable exchange and should be used with caution, they are doing shady business the exact way that hurts crypto adoption. I hope anyone that finds this message will take a second look and do business with a better more competent exchange."
coinbase,ios,Austxxn,4,2021-12-24 05:25:14,"As a new user of Coinbase I was really excited to see the vast number of cryptocurrencies available on the platform. Right away I began trading and everything was very easy to navigate. The platform is visually pleasing, easy to use and get started, and also offers a wide selection of coins to trade from. 

My only complaint is that there is no (easy) way to see how much I’ve gained or lost since the time of purchase. What I mean by this is that on other trading apps when you buy a coin/stock you are able to immediately see how much the value has increased or decreased which gives you a good indication of when to sell and how to track gains and losses. 

Unless I am mistaken, the Coinbase app doesn’t offer this feature. You can see the current price of the asset and how much it has gone up within a specific time frame and your current balance in local currency as well as the conversion amount (e.g. 
         $512
          0.01 BTC
)

I would really like to see Coinbase add another drop down option on the “Your Assets” page that shows exactly how much the value of each asset has changed since the original purchase as well as its current value. 

(E.g.
 
Bitcoin           $50,000   <— current price
                     +$1,000     <— change in value since time of purchase

)

I hope this finds the right person or team.

coinbase,ios,tmcbride123,2,2021-11-18 00:51:43,Sadly their fees are ridiculously high. I was trading on Robinhood for free and very happy.  I wanted to buy Solana and Robinhood did not offer it so I went to Coinbase.   I then thought I would use this app and company to handle my crypto trades.  They charge high fees when buying and converting cash to crypto or crypto to cash. Also if you trade one crypto for another they ding you too even though they advertise they don’t charge for exchanging crypto. Seems to me they are basically like some of the big banks just interested in making money charging you for fees for everything. Things are not very transparent either.  For example trying to calculate your gains and losses is not possible on the app. You have to track your purchase price vs the market prices. Robinhood makes this very easy so it can be done but feels like Coinbase just wants to keep you in the dark on whether you are making money or losing your shirt.  It’s very burdensome to manage your investments in my opinion. I am looking for a new trading platform.
coinbase,ios,Team O'Malley,1,2025-01-12 00:29:17,"I got duped into signing up for this app from a friend. I paid for their upgrade of $35/month for what was perceived to be unlimited trades. What I failed to learn until later is that it’s unlimited trades up to $10K worth of trades. So if you have larger funds or want to make multiple trades you’re done. They charge approx a 1% spread so your underwater as soon as you make your trade, then they charge you approx a 2% upfront fee. So for example, let’s say you feel a coin is going to pump. If you buy the coin 3% in spread and fees, the. You sell the coin 3% in spread and fees and God forbid you buy it back 3% in spread and fees. So you’d be out 9% in that scenario. Good luck finding good enough trades to justify paying that much on your trades. When I reached out to customer care to tell them I had unlimited trades they informed me that there was a $10k cap and then trades go back to full fees. When I asked for a refund they told me to kick rocks. I liquidated my account and I’ll take my business to Kraken. Don’t waste your time! They’re rip off artists."
coinbase,ios,TiagoGMarques,5,2022-04-02 11:59:18,"I opened an account on coinbase solely for the purpose of getting a cryptocurrency and then transferring it to another wallet for an application. I transferred my funds from my bank account which took a couple of hours. Inside my coinbase account the cryptocurrency was immediately purchased but surprisingly the amount is ON HOLD FOR 15 DAYS!!! Now I have a considerable amount of money in a cryptocurrency, subject to its volatility, that I cannot use for the purpose that I purchased it. This is unacceptable and doesn’t make sense. If it’s for security purposes, then why does coinbase allow me to purchase the cryptocurrency immediately but does not allow me to use it? Of course I can always sell the cryptocurrency back to USD but for every transaction there is a significant fee that I have to pay. Cannot possibly recommend this app!"

The instructions are complicated and I have no confidence, even if can decipher them, that this will resolve the problem. The support people are often not very fluent in English, which makes the situation even more frustrating . Today one of the customer service employees just hung up on me when they could not answer my questions or solve my problem. No wonder their stock is dropping like a rock. Dealing with Coinbase is way too hard and takes the fun out of trying to trade crypto currencies. They  are treating me like a security risk who is trying to break into my account, instead of an actual customer with a tech problem locking him out of his own account. I am no tech expert and sadly Coinbase is making it difficult or impossible to access my own account on my computer. Crazy way to run a company!"
coinbase,ios,23jours,1,2021-04-27 18:20:41,The data you want to evaluate your investment is just not there. For example in Robinhood - it tells you how much you have made or lost each day on your investment and it tells you how much in total you have lost or made on that invest since your first transaction. You can create separate lists just for your investments in Robinhood. The transactions take FOREVER to finalize- which is really insane since this is supposedly based off a blockchain and it should be instantaneous! You get notified days and days later that a transaction has finally gone through when you thought it had days beforehand. It appeared that it had because the money was “available” but apparently technically it wasn’t yet. They just fronted you the money. It becomes very confusing when you are a moderate to heavy trader. I wish I could say there is a better app for this but none of them are user friendly. If you want to trade certain cryptos then you have to use certain apps. There is no app that does them all so at least for now this app is a necessary evil.

It has been close to a year. I have called multiple times and have been promised many things, none of which have been true. My second major issue is that my Coinbase card was deactivated for no reason and could not be reactived. It was very inconvenient and absolutely pointless, considering there was no issue with my card. They said it was done by mistake and couldn't be reversed.  The customer service is beyond pitiful and I do not feel secure leaving any significant amount of money in there Coinbase app in any crypto or usd form.

Make sure to read about everything that you buy and all rules regarding particular transactions. Not all are the same. Furthermore, the deals and trades they offer are fair, and sometimes better than what you would see on something like CoinMarketCap. If a coin is listed on Coinbase, I will usually find that the price is better or more up to date on here versus something like CoinMarketCap. However just remember to only buy what you would be willing to lose or go a long time without!
On another note, my only issue thus far is that I have never been told whether I won or did not win during any of their sweepstakes. If they could communicate that to me, it would be a 6-star review!"

This has disappointed me greatly and I will no longer be recommending Coinbase to anyone, as their customer service has been less than helpful.

I was fine using coinbase UNTIL I had to contact their customer support. Per one of the ""reps"" I spoke to the call center is only 3 months old & that is very obvious. They can't answer BASIC questions & after speaking to several different people it seems supplementing their ignorance with rudeness is a company policy. I am moving my assets to another exchange. 
As long as your account is fine & you have no issues, concerns, questions coinbase is fine. The minute you have to contact them you will probably conclude that your money is safer elsewhere. & It's fine to have customer service representatives to answer basic questions but there should be people knowledgeable about crypto to speak to when you have significant money invested with a company.

So as someone you use your service I do and many other also have assets stored with you and we will highly appreciate if any developers and at least buckle down on the connection issues. At least if you want good standing with community I love your interface but blow your competitors out of the water by ironing the issues that are dangerous like being in a trade and having a connection error is scary.

I’ve tried the others and some of them I can’t even get started they are so complicated. This app lets you simply transfer money to your account using one of several methods and buy what you want quickly. I use the transfer via PayPal which is extremely easy and fast. It also has an easy to read display and a not confusing or complicated like the other apps. 

One recommendation for the developer would be to not start off asking for info when I first download and open the app. Let me see the app and features  first to feel comfortable with it, then let’s talk about my personal details. I understand they are required by law to invest, but having to hand them out before I even know I want to use your app made me feel uncomfortable and not wanting to proceed."
coinbase,ios,Nickname470987,5,2024-07-16 11:33:51,"I am in my 50s and I remember a time before computers. Before cellphone. Before… the Empire. We have come a long way since the 1970s, and so has our money. The US dollar is not money. It is a debt based currency that the “Federal” Reserve has practically printed into extinction. Many Crypto currencies on the other hand, meet the definition of “money,” just as gold and other items that store value. 

Coinbase is very user friendly. Especially for GenX. While it took some time to learn how to use it, CoinBase offered “free” cyrpto as an incentive. Once I was on the exchange, I discovered that it is easy to buy and sell tokens, send them to any of my private wallets, or despots my earnings as USD back into my bank acct. 

A couple of things I want to note. 
Coinbase is compliant with all state and federal regulations, and keep a track record for your CPA. 
Coinbase offers incentives to hold your money by staking tokens such as Solana, Ethereum, and even USDC, and the APR is much better than any bank I know of currently operating in the US. 
While I have had my technological challenges, their customer service has been very helpful in helping me resolve them in a timely manner. 
I very rarely wrote reviews anymore, but Coinbase has earned it.
5 Stars. Highly recommend."

I tried to authenticate but every document I’ve submitted has been rejected, including passports, government issued IDs, government drivers licenses showing my German address, and further documentation proving I’m who I am, a US citizen, residing in Germany. I’ve gone through each step their website offers to try to resolve the issue, but they simply left the account as is, unverified, and said it’s been resolved. They never reached out for any further clarification. In their FAQ section, it turns out they don’t really have a remedy for this situation, but essentially have shrugged off responsibility and tell their customers that if they’re in my situation, they’re simply out of luck. It’s 2021, and frankly the combo of no customer service beyond impersonal emails and account actions is completely unacceptable, especially when finances are involved.

I’ve heard people say that CB has “outages” at key moments and people have missed out on great trades. I don’t know if that’s happened or not, but if it has, it’s never negatively impacted me. So 🤷‍♂️

Coinbase has been solid for me. I have access to most of what I want to trade, and there’s plenty of ultra fast tokens here to buy and send off to a wallet for swaps. 

I use xlm because it’s accepted everywhere, super fast, has ultra low fees, and is practically a stable coin at $.10! So it feels like a good bang for your buck right off the bat! Just don’t buy into a peak and hold into a valley. You’ll see

Tips:

Don’t store the bulk of your crypto on any exchange. Not your keys, not your crypto is real

Figure out what you want, what wallets support it, and do the research on a good cold storage setup

Factory direct is the only “safe” way to purchase a cold storage wallet. Inspect all packaging and devices for any irregularities. If sus, arrange a return/exchange

Find a good hot wallet (internet wallet) and keep a small/medium bag there for quick trades, purchases, and cash outs

Follow your wallets, exchanges, crypto projects, regulatory agencies, & current heads of state/agency on social media

Check your bags often

Be aware

I have been fighting with them for several months to close my account and transfer my money back to my personal bank without success!!

Coinbase has a division called Know You Customer which starts asking for proof of where you get the funds from, they request payment slips, income statements, retirement income etc, etc and never stop asking for more, in the meantime they restrict your account and all you can do is see your balance,  with a pop up sign stating that your money is “safe in Coinbase”.  I have been requesting them to close my account and transfer my money back but all they reply is “your account is under review”.  I am a veteran and never transferred crypto anywhere I just bought to hold, yet Coinbase is investigating me as if I were a crypto criminal, it is outrageous.

(I use a newer model iPhone, i don't think my camera is the problem) I also attempted to submit a customer support ticket In order to get this Issue fixed.

To make matters worse, the identification method they have in place doesn't even work properly. After spending a significant amount of time trying to comply with their demands, it's clear that this is nothing but a waste of time. It's frustrating to see that Coinbase seems completely indifferent to the inconvenience and potential risks they're subjecting their users to.

It's disheartening that a platform dealing with financial transactions and sensitive data isn't taking the necessary steps to ensure a secure environment. Given the increasing importance of online privacy, Coinbase's cavalier attitude towards user data is simply unacceptable.

On the business level: small hiccups with ID verification, terrible support for customers that change their country, inexistent customer service and high fees for trading.
On the app level: the UI seems to deteriorate over time. Whereas back when coinbase would only support 2/3 cryptos it was easy to see their trends and easy to see where the market is going, now all the relevant information is hidden behind a bunch of clicks. An attempt to mimic Robinhood with some information about the coin and news also takes up room from what could be potentially more interesting info.

From focusing on democraticizing crypto Coinbase has moved onto a get rich quick investing platform at detriment of their customers. Unfortunately people still have to use it because of lack of decent competition, but I‘m sure this will change soon if they continue to ignore their users."

Even zooming in on the our view does not help because the latest information is cut off. Thankfully there are other places where this information is available however not having clear visibility on the asset prices and their latest development makes it very difficult to plan without using another reference.

I've been using Coinbase since February of 2021. The hidden fees were a trip trying to figure out around that time. Yes I'm glad you all decided to show how much it'll be for the network fee. I'm not a fan of the other hidden fee that most people who are just starting out may not even know about. Coinbase should state how much it'll be to transfer one crypto to the other before hitting the submit button. 

I've also seen a lot of great changes but some changes were making me think someone must have been really toasted while programming. 

For those out there who should know, try to not use your real cell phone number. Years ago it was about hiding your ss number. Now it's about your phone number. Use something like MySudo and use that free number only for this platform. 
I read through the comments and see people say they've been getting hack while having such and such amount of dollars. Do you really trust this company with that amount of money? Look into cold storage wallets and hodl on those.

They shouldn’t be allowed to do business if they cannot help their customers. So then 2 of my purchases went through as I was able to fix things on my end .

Original and elegant without be unintuitive. Missing details like minute candels for traders but not the poiint. 
-2017: 6/10 was basically a poor responsive design port of the website then. 

----2024 Performance/Stability 
10/10

It's so nice to see all the common laggy use cases ACTUALLY WORK as fast as they were originally intended.  They app is never the shortcoming or slow chain in the link of tech than tells me how much I can sell x for $$.

-2017: 2/10 Single Sign On alone was hard, toggling airplane mode was commonly a ""fix"" for laggy transactions 

-2024 Custodial wallet features: 6/10. Good support for normal use cases. Poor support for things like multiple addresses per coin/network.  Also wallet only competitors for the mess that is  bridging coins vs swapong, but this was -never it's core use case 
2017: 3/10.. hard to even receive a crypto coin then

-Trading platform features: I'm  not qualified to review, but cool."

And much to my chagrin that’s been a nightmare. The service is below average with Kraken. Don’t waste your time or your money. I’m still trying to get my money back. The Kraken team as they call themselves, keeps tripping over each other even though they all work from home I was told. They have no business being in the business that they’re in. They’re absolutely clueless. But then I come. Coin Base and there’s just no comparison to Coin Base’s superior. They know what to do. They are very professional, and they take care of things very quickly and very simply. I feel like they’re on my side. Absolutely love Coin Base so if you’re looking for a good crypto wallet, this is the one I guarantee it."

And that is the experience, and trust I have with this excellent company- Coinbase. They are great to work with. Understand the urgency we all get and respond with patience of patience black belts. All the while, their software SHOWs all the everything, like it was made for a movie or something. On the phone, and at my pc, I have wonderful and seemless transaction; as well as an entire BASE of professionals GUARDing my assets. I’ll admit, i like having a strong team, and I have been very happy I decide to trust Coinbase over a decade ago, and am still a satisfied customer. From a happy customer, Thank you !"
coinbase,ios,TDDSilva51,1,2022-05-06 16:17:27,"I was going to use my account again and realized the phone number was outdated with one I do not remember. I followed the steps concerning not having access to old phone. It still asked old phone to be verified. Phone service would not put me through with verifying old phone. I then emailed service and was told to do what I have already tried. After explaining that, I was told to go create a new account with a new email and submit info with my ID so Coinbase can determine if they will allow me access to update my phone on old account. The whole time, we are emailing from the email on my current account. A whole lot of trouble I do not have time for. When a phone number is changed, why do these companies expect you to keep the old number active?
These types of apps and services have become available at a dime a dozen. Find you one that has real customer service with an actual rep. Imagine if I had set this up to handle all of my money and ended up in this situation! My money would be gone!!!!"
coinbase,ios,JNROBINS,1,2022-03-29 13:01:42,"I have used Coinbase for several years. Recently, however, the app glitched during a purchase and accidentally made a duplicate purchase. I was unable to do anything about it so reached out to support. There is no one live you can talk to so I was forced to submit my request and wait for an email correspondence. Even though I submitted very thorough documentation outlining exactly what happened (which included two simultaneous transactions that could not have possibly both been initiated by me), I was tossed around from several different people over email who continued to misunderstand the situation. After 2.5weeks of back and forth emails, I received no resolution and then Coinbase sold the duplicate transaction (again without authorization or warning), but at a significant loss since BTC had crashed. All said, 2 unauthorized transactions, terrible customer support, and a ~$4000 loss all because of Coinbase’s incompetency. 

PLEASE STAY AWAY and use Gemini or some other platform that isn’t going to completely screw you."
coinbase,ios,Jesseondrums,1,2021-10-11 16:47:56,"My original review discussed the shady tactics they employ as you’ll read among other reviewers- inaccurate prices, purchasing at higher prices then they’re currently listed at. Selling at lower prices than what’s listed plus they charge you for transfers and deposits. 
Their response to my review was “we recommend you look at our purchase policies” basically saying, we’re allowed to be shady, we wrote it in the million word fine print. 
That’s a little update to the old stuff now the new:
Sold my shares and withdrew my funds to be deposited in my bank. That was two weeks ago. It says it was done but the money is not in my account and my account was disconnected from Coinbase. So now I have to contact them to get this rectified. 
Save yourself the time, money and head ache. Use something else. Most people don’t see the small discrepancies or they don’t experience then yet because they are selling or withdrawing. I don’t trust them and I wish I read through all of the reviews before I risked my money like I did"
coinbase,ios,Rostom M,1,2021-05-26 13:38:28,"I’ve been in the Crypto market for more than 2 years so let me tell you my experience with Coinbase App. It is the world most expensive & highest fee for trading Cryptos all over the globe 🌎 
After using this app for about a month now trying to make some profit I finally found that by using this App I am losing on every transaction. They took so much money from you when you buy, when you sell, & when you withdraw to your bank account. Therefore, I decided that when the market go up for little bit I will move all my money out to another App. I just wanna return the money I have started with then no longer gonna use you greedy service. I just need to tell the developer & the owner that: You’re using the People who trusted you, it doesn’t make any scene that you makes so much money and other traders makers nothing. You’re taking our profit and the equation is win/lose not win/win.
Bye bye very soon will not return back to your App ever again & will tell all my friends and family about it."
coinbase,ios,2FA camera deficient,5,2025-01-25 22:46:15,My app suddenly stoped allowing access to my account and will not access my camera for 2FA access.  The camera isn’t even a selectable option when viewing the app in the i-phone settings.  My wallet works and does allow me to select access to the camera (turn on and off as I want to). Since the app cannot access the camera the Authenticator app can’t log me into my Coinbase account. Maybe having face recognition isn’t better than a pin key.  The phone is running the most recent software version.  The app has been deleted and reinstalled several times and the phone has been rebooted several time.  This is without a doubt an app issue.  I have contacted and worked with Apple Support who asked me to work with the app developers.
coinbase,ios,Jimjimma5,1,2024-04-08 13:11:03,"I would give this app zero stars if I could. The only reason I chose this platform to purchase Bitcoin is because it has a good reputation. However, in an effort to maintain their reputation they go way above and beyond to make it extremely difficult to buy crypto. Once you finally have an account set up and linked to your bank account, it severely limits the amount you are allowed to purchase at one time, and the reason why is completely arbitrary. They literally just make up numbers based on their algorithm. If you try talking to customer service, be prepared for the biggest waste of time. I spent hours speaking with people who had no idea what they were doing or how to explain even the simplest things. Then my transaction was failed with no explanation even though it was under the daily limit. No matter how many times you ask, they will never let you speak with a supervisor or anyone that has any level of competency. I’ve lost out on thousands of dollars in potential investment returns thanks to coinbase."
coinbase,ios,Ooowen369,1,2024-03-05 04:04:53,"I opened the account last year and uploaded my driver’s license; the account worked fine for one year. However, since last week, as the market began to rise, I bought some coins using my bank account and paid a $4 fee per transaction, which is ridiculously expensive. Suddenly, my account is under review. I can’t sell, deposit cash, or transfer funds.

I contacted customer support, and since I didn’t have Coinbase One, I waited in line for 2 hours, but no one helped. After paying $30 for Coinbase One, support finally contacted me. However, all they could say was that my account is under review without providing any reason. They told me to wait for an email.

If you do some research online, a lot of people are experiencing the same thing. I don’t expect this can be solved for another months. Don’t use this platform, they can lock you money for months without any explanation. I just hope I can transfer my fund and close the account as soon as possible."
coinbase,ios,DigitalTemerity,5,2021-07-28 21:39:50,"Coinbase is an app for iOS and other OSs that is also an Internet based wallet you can keep your funds in or transfer it to your hardware wallet.  It is also available as a website.

Coinbase is so much more than just a simple exchange though.  It offers individualized charts of your portfolio including charts of individual currencies and up-to-date pricing charts for many popular currencies.

It also keeps you updated on the latest news articles from authoritative sources updated on an hourly basis.  Coinbase charges fees scaled on the amount of cash you spend and allows you to use PayPal.  I usually buy $26 allotments of currency at a fee of $1.49.  You can buy up to $50 for $1.99.  So the more you spend the less you pay in fees but I am simply an enthusiast.

I see the potential of crypto currency and want a piece of it.  I dabble with it at the moment to see how I do and then down the road who knows.  I never ever invest money I can’t afford to lose, so no harm to me if the bottom falls out of the market however disappointing that may be.  I am careful to diversify my holdings and buy from more than one exchange.  Coinbase however is definitely the most informative and useful exchange I use."
coinbase,ios,zero mystic,4,2023-07-12 03:52:56,"Why did you guys remove the table that showed profits/loss and the average price paid on each assets page? I’m canceling my monthly Coinbase one subscription till this is fixed. And don’t get their card, it’s got zero security, after a month of getting my card I kept getting fraudulent charges on it that I didn’t make, their months long process didn’t refund my stolen money.
Edit July 2023: Your current Recurring buys page on the app is also gone which showed all the current recurring buys one currently has set up which is yet another downgrade, hence I’m taking another star off. Now it just takes you to the asset page so you can set up a new recurring buy and manually track it via transactions.
TLDR: These guys are removing all the features that made the app simple and great in the first place."
coinbase,ios,fjjjcccbv,1,2022-06-08 19:47:13,"I hold shares in Coinbase stock so I know first hand the business is crap at the moment.. probably why they won’t honor my referrals … probably why I should sell. Unethical business doesn’t deserve to keep going. I do not support this platform. On top of that 2 times before they tried charging me for payments I already made. Locked me out of my acount and froze my assets at a critical time making me loose even more money. My bank had to sort it out for me they where that stubborn about it. Like these people literally tried to jip me and thought I wouldn’t notice. Don’t be fooled by other reviews on here … I have an online business and I know how to get 5 star reviews… and as to their response? Iv gone threw customer service with them before. Doesn’t work. That’s why I had my bank take back the money for me cus they refused…. 

Edit I keep rating it one star but somehow it’s saying I rate it 5 stars … if I could rate this app with negative stars I would … these exchange companies have gotten out of hand and need to be fined or ban"
coinbase,ios,Nik2️⃣1️⃣7️⃣,1,2022-03-28 12:41:36,"Overall, I really enjoyed using Coinbase. It is extremely easy to use and they don’t seem to charge too much on fees. However, after having my money basically stolen by Coinbase due to the “We’re having connection issues” screen that pops up every time I want to look at my funds or transfer money, I guarantee that you do not want to use this app. Upon doing my due diligence and looking for a solution, I found out that this is an unresolved issue dating back TWO YEARS. There are people who never found a solution and have been continuously ignored by Coinbase support. If they can resolve this issue I would have no problem changing my review, but more people need to be made aware of this issue because it seems like this is just out of negligence on Coinbase’s part.

Edit: I forgot to mention that coinbase has the worst customer service. The only way you can contact them is through a live messaging app. No phone number, no email, just you “texting” support to try and fix your problem."
coinbase,ios,skreidler22,1,2021-12-08 18:35:15,I recently joined coinbase about a month ago. Since then ive had multiple problems with the app and ive tried contacting coinbase but they have the worst customer service out there. Waited on hold for about 2 hours on a Wednesday morning. Given it said estimated wait time was 35 minutes. Tried using there online customer service on there webpage and it was no help as well. Finally got through to someone on the phone and the gentlemen that helped me was very polite (Name: Owen). He was not able to help with my problem and just connected me to another hold line. Waited again on hold for about another 40 minutes before I just gave up. In total wasted about 4 hours of my day trying to fix this problem and in conclusion nothing came of it. This is why I will be swithcing to an alternative platform. I STRONGLY RECOMMEND all others to do so as well. Just very disapointed with the app so far and I hope they use this information to improve their services.
coinbase,ios,SprintAdam,2,2021-02-13 01:57:18,"Interface is easy to use and very easy to become accommodated with the functions. However, I used the referral link to invite my roommate who then followed the requirement of purchasing $100 worth of crypto (they purchased $105 actually) and over 6 weeks later, neither of us has received the $10 in free Stellar Lumens. I’ve emailed support 3 times now and only get an automated reply saying they’re receiving too many emails and responses may be delayed. At the time, XLM was around $.24 a token and they’re currently sitting at $.57. $10 or $20 may not be a lot, but it’s the principle. It’s good business to honor that which you advertise. Since this dilemma, I’ve started using Gemini and Exodus more often. They have honored their referral rewards so I believe they may be more honest and appreciative of the business on their platform. Hoping this is eventually resolved, but I suppose time will tell. Make sure you only invest what you’re willing to lose! But there are other, more honest and sincere exchanges and wallets."
coinbase,ios,Blackford32,1,2020-04-06 22:30:35,"Downloaded this app through a recommendation from a friend and it’s truly terrible. Impossible to verify your bank account because it has an error every 5 seconds. Asked me to verify my license by sending a picture, which I did, and it came back with an error. Unable to verify my bank account by my account number and routing number, which are correct, but instead it just gives me error messages. Now I have money in here that I can deposit back into my bank account. They had no problem verifying my identity and my bank account when I was depositing money, but now that I want to withdraw there are all kinds of hoops to jump through that the app can’t even process. I don’t think I’ve ever actually left a review on the App Store until now, that’s how much this app has angered me. Developers need to figure it out. And until they do, you need to use a different service instead. I switched all of my stuff over to CashApp and it works much better than this garbage. I’d give it 0 stars if I could. Seriously just don’t download this app."
coinbase,ios,my nickname is Fergie,3,2023-05-13 19:11:18,"Coinbase is a great crypto exchange. That being said it has its kinks. Recently I went to add funds the day after maxing out my daily limits on my account I have had for 3 years, raising my daily limit along the way. The next day, I thought oh it’s a new day I will add some more money.  I got a very weird error that was not clear at all. I retried several times to see if the error would go away and my transaction would go through. They then lowered my daily limit to where now I can barely add money onto my Coinbase account. Because the DAILY limit is a 7 DAY LIMIT… but they don’t tell you that anywhere.. they definitely drop the ball in several places. Also if you want to get a hold of a real person you need to call customer support on the card services side of Coinbase because anywhere else is stupid chat support and they give you general answers to your serious problems."
coinbase,ios,Derek737,5,2020-01-05 01:20:29,"Great and easy to use app for trading any type of crypto. Definitely seems to be one of the more popular versions as well for good reason. Although I would lower the fees a bit. Even if other apps charge high fees as well, it would be nice if they take the route that other investment banks have taken lately to offer zero to very low fees for trades. Another piece of constructive criticism I must give though would be for the app to better explain in detail what your net gain is compared to the amount of money you have invested. That way your not just looking at a broad percentage between all your currencies or having to sit and do the math yourself based on how much I’ve invested verses it’s current value of each individual one. Other then that it’s great! 👍 and I highly recommend for anyone interested in trading bitcoin or any other crypto."
coinbase,ios,RMS1983,4,2021-05-16 13:33:46,I’ve been using this app for 2 months. I like the learning about crypto when being gifted by Coinbase. As the information about the new coins or some projects are very interesting to learn about. If the developers would add a night mode and better tracking charts or options to see red and green candles or live graphs. I would give this app a 5 star rating. They continue to list more  coins. I just can’t see all coins listed when I type some alt coins in. Also some coins aren’t tradable. I do like the coins listed. But coinbase seems to have a limit of value. They don’t list anything lower than .12. Please just do the community a favor add night mode and better charts. Also CoinTracker linking is very useful. They do charge fees and I find them fair for the amount I buy.
coinbase,ios,casual coun guy,2,2021-01-25 02:49:03,"Its an easy to use app but there are a few issues that have made me not like this app as much as I did at first.

First and foremost is while monitoring ETH I “traded” at 1395, selling 5 ETH for USD. On the sales report it said the trade price was $1381 A 14$ DIFFERENCE! I sit there and refresh the price constantly, and it hadn’t been $1381 for at least 5 minutes. So getting jilted out of $14 x 5 coins plus their high fees ate up almost 20% of my trade. Thats after fees just to buy coins too. Not very impressed and kind of sketchy if you ask me. 

Next is an interface issue. When you want to put your USD$ back into your linked bank acct you have to select the “withdraw” option instead of the “deposit” option. You are withdrawing the cash from the app acct back into your bank acct and a deposit pulls money out of your bank and deposits it into your app acct. This unclear wording made me nearly overdraw and even worse, since it takes my bank a few days to process the transaction (both withdraw and deposit), I had no access to my money for over a week which was frustrating. 

Another issue is the fees themselves. Very high if you’re trying to do times trades. 

Last issue off the top of my head is the lack of Monero trading. 

Its a good app for beginners who just want to learn I suppose but I’m a bit disappointed in the discrepancy between my sale trade price and their reported sale trade price which seemed dishonest."
coinbase,ios,A81&D07,5,2021-10-23 16:59:45,"Coinbase is a platform to purchase crypto, but there’s so much more that they offer! Generous rewards program, interest earning potential by obtaining specific crypto (Coinbase explains it every step of the way) with fantastic insights. What separates Coinbase from the rest is their long running reputation as well as their stellar learning program with tutorials that gives users the opportunity to understand and grow their knowledge into the evolving market of crypto currency. I’m a loyal Coinbase user and would recommend anyone who is thinking of investing to try using Coinbase. I am proud to say that I opened my account here on December of 2017, I think only 4 coins were available at that time! I love watching Coinbase grow and continue its efforts to help educate others! Easy 5 star rating!!"
coinbase,ios,OnlyTheTruth1278,1,2025-02-24 21:14:10,"Between the promos not working and the fees on everything I wouldn’t even give this 1 star, mostly because of false advertising promotions. Since the promotions do not work once everything has been done and you get the notification stating the requirements are met this would be considered false advertising. The reward wasn’t provided and also since I have tried going through the app and there is no way to get legitimate help from a representative they clearly do not care about customer service. Much work is needed as your word to customers should be everything. Now I’m sure I’m not the only one this has happened to. The bugs need fixed right away and if you promote something be on top of it when issues occur. I am sure someone has been made aware of this as it’s been over a week since I completed everything. Principles must be upheld cause if the people can’t trust deals to be upheld why should they trust the app enough to deposit their own cash onto it."
coinbase,ios,jeep27030,1,2023-03-29 18:37:04,I got hacked. I’ve asked Coinbase to unblock my account so I could see if anything was left. They said they would work on it. So they sent me an email with a case number and said to communicate through that email. I have emailed them 4 times and I have not received a reply of any kind. I’ve called them 5 times and the last time I had to search for their number since the one I was using was disconnected. Each time I called they assured me that they are working on it. Still nothing. Almost two weeks now so I am convinced Coinbase is a scam. I know many whose account got wiped out on Coinbase. I Don’t know even one person who has been hacked on the other exchanges that I use. Thank God Coinbase was my 3rd smallest account. When I got scammed I had two factor I’d. A very secure password and a secure password on my email. I used finger print and Authenticator to log in. I got hacked anyway. Of course Coinbase doesn’t even try to get the crypto back. My sister got hacked last year also. It’s not a secure exchange AT ALL!!!
coinbase,ios,Joe Vir,1,2021-11-02 02:43:10,"When I traded my Ethereum to Shiba Inu today, I experienced a multiple fees for every failed transactions made with high fees that I don’t even know what happened during the trade. They charged me many times due to failed transactions maybe because of the congested traffics due to the rise of Shiba Inu. Although it’s not my fault that Shiba Inu broke the internet today. They should not charged me because of failed transactions…Just beware on using this app because they’re going to charge you higher fees even though there’s no complete transactions made. They charged me more than $200 today for nothing at all…Since nobody is answering my email and their customer service or support are all “bots” and you can’t even contact them either…I will just leave a message/review here with regards to my experience so you will not be the next victim in using this app…and hope they will return the fees incurred during those failed transactions made due to congestion or whatever!!!🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲"
coinbase,ios,ed741,5,2021-04-12 18:25:08,"App is great until you encounter your first issue that requires customer service assistant - at this point you are on your own.

I had to liquidate all my positions, suffered a great amount of fees and faults and all I can say is that I won’t leave it at there but a company claiming to be in the crypto business but is no wear near designed to have that much attention. 

Shame on them. The bureaus will be receiving my report."
coinbase,ios,papadear,1,2021-02-21 19:21:44,"I’ve had Coinbase on my phone for almost a year now, and though the fees were ridiculously high for swing trading, at least the the app was informative. After the upgrade, you can no longer see spark lines in the watch list (at least I think that’s what they’re called), and even worse, you don’t see the whole range of price for coins you’re trading anymore. By that I mean, if a certain coin is at let’s say .56, you don’t see the small changes within the cent range, such as: .5648 and so on. Now it’s just rounded up or down to the nearest cent. That’s huge if you want to make quick moves within a cent range for small gains on low priced coins! It’s like they decided “Hmmm, this app is too user friendly and we can’t screw people out of as much money now. Seems pretty sus to me. How this app still has 5 stars is a mystery to me. Read the reviews thoroughly. Its pretty clear people are frustrated too and moving to different platforms to trade. Please Bring back the old layout Coinbase!!!!"

coinbase,ios,Donjohndon,1,2020-06-01 04:52:47,This app could’ve been great. But I’m not going to discuss with could’ve been. The fact is they have the most horrible and I mean the worst customer service I have ever experienced in my existence. They disable me from purchasing cryptocurrency with no explanation whatsoever their customer service told me that it can take 5 to 10 business days or even more for someone to get back to me but I guess I’m on the “more” end of that process because it’s been over 3 months and no one has gotten back to me and no one responds to or answers any of my correspondences. They have no respect for the customers whatsoever I highly suggest that no one waste their time utilizing this app anymore because once something goes wrong you’re left alone to handle it. This application would have been Highly recommended by me if it was not for that one huge/great flaw.  There are many other apps to keep you away from headaches and stress which this company gives a lot of so delete and or stay away from them. Hope this helps some people.
coinbase,ios,Rack_City_Brax,1,2018-09-17 13:33:46,"So I’ve been using Coinbase for about a year and some change now and slowly it’s started to go down. I synced up my bank account because it has a higher buy per week and I’ve done this multiple times before so I went to purchase some BTC and for the first time in, let’s say 18 months, I had a 20 day fraud hold put on my purchase. I sent in help tickets and emails back and forth verifying I made the purchase, I went and verified my drivers license as well as a selfie (they requested I do it to show someone didn’t snag my license) and STILL it didn’t release. Finally one day it released and I had about 15% taken out to which they said that was due to the fluctuation of BTC cost. If they didn’t put the fraud hold on it, I would’ve had ALL of what I purchased (minus the small fee). Then today I went on to look at my balance and everything because something in my mind was telling me to look at my account and BAM the fraud hold is back on my account and I have a balance of $0 for the next 2 days....no help from customer service or the company.

Just saw someone else that’s with the same bank withdraw funds to their debit card with no issue. To add your bank account it will take 3-5 business days unless you use a 3rd party which makes no sense. Coinbase clearly does not care because other people have complained about this and I’ve seen no reasonable explanation for why it’s not working. I just transferred all my coins off the platform to uphold and withdrew within 2 minutes. I don’t recommend this platform to anyone it’s clear they don’t care about their customers or resolving on going issues. I won’t be back."

I never authorize them to withdraw money from my checking account. Now they are texting me that they want the $2500 back that money is mine so I am reporting them to the fraud department of my bank. They will investigate them and handle this matter for me. I have also locked my Coinbase account..  anyone who is having trouble withdrawing their money. I suggest you contact the fraud department of your bank and let them know what is going on and they will investigate and I’m sure they’ll get your money for you for. I did get my money back and I’m appreciative of that but now they’re wanting me to return $2500 which is my $2500 and this $2500. They did withdraw try to withdraw out of my bank without authorization. thank God the manager of the bank saw this withdrawal and knew it was not correct so she sent she sent it back so I’m sorry, Coinbase but you’re doing wrong"
coinbase,ios,Дирки,1,2024-06-07 00:19:11,"During the period of high demand for cryptocurrency, I topped up my balance with a debit card, after which I bought Bitcoin. They debited the money from my bank account. A few days later, I find out that they sold my Bitcoin to cover the payment because payment was canceled (they had “”a server error”” and many payments were canceled, and they refunded the money to the card). Without any prior notification! I found out about it only after the fact. The support team didn’t even think about apologizing or compensating for the losses. At first, I thought I was hacked! The Bitcoin was sold automatically, I paid REALLY BIG commissions for buying and selling, and I had to buy bitcoin again at price 3000$ higher than the original price. 

This is common practice on crypto exchanges, but I thought Coinbase was a reputable organization and wouldn’t engage in such deceitful fraud. I do not recommend keeping any funds with them or using them in general; they have huge commissions. A waste of time and money."
coinbase,ios,Dr. Lysol,1,2022-06-15 00:12:55,"DO NOT USE this app, they wont let you withdraw your crypto or your money freely.
My DL just expired days before I tried to withdraw my crypto, when I tried they came with this “to withdraw you have to validate your ID” process which is stupid when you have 2factor authentication activated. Anyways, I tried to get a new one but DMV is pretty slow, DMV gave me a temporary paper to drive instead so I couldn't get a renewed DL to show them. Coinbase do not accept passports (which is absurd) and they don't give you alternatives to the DL, they don't want to help you at all. 
The other day I finally got my new DL so I validated my ID, even then they were causing problems with the pictures I sent, so another day lost. Then, yesterday, when I tried to withdraw they block my account for 24h saying “we block any account if you log in from a new device”, I was logging in from the same computer I use to log in since I created the account!! I will not trust Coinbase with my money or my crypto again."

But when I’m in the app and click the pop up screen and the blue button it just takes me to the settings . No camera option to take the picture to verify. Now on the computer in the Coinbase page it says to go into the document verification page and it shows lit up like it will take you and that leads to a 404 error page.

They’ve played a huge role in bringing new people and money into the crypto space, and they also help smaller projects gain visibility. However, my main issue with Coinbase is their overly compliant stance with U.S. regulators. While compliance is necessary, it would be great to see them push back a little instead of rolling over every time new regulations come up. A more balanced approach—one that advocates for innovation and decentralization—would make Coinbase an even stronger player in the industry.

Overall, it’s a solid platform, but I wish Brian Armstrong would take a firmer stance on protecting the crypto ecosystem."

They told me not to come to Coinbase but did I listen? No. So I opened an account. Added my bank account and purchased a hefty amount of crypto. I purchased 3 different types. Long story short a few days later. I went to purchase more and they kept failing my transactions saying that my bank said I had insufficient funds. I had plentyyyyyyyy Of money in my account. However I called my bank and they there is no issues or hold ups. Mind you this took a couple of Hours to get straight. Well the stock I was wanting to invest to make profits in ended up sky rocketing and I couldn’t get any transactions because their system would not allow me to spend money. Well now fast forward 6+ days and they finally get back to me with no customer service that actually would take care of me. Do not go here. Don’t spend money here. Go to any other place for your fiat currency switch. They do not care about their clients at Coinbase.
coinbase,ios,I hunks,1,2017-12-29 15:39:34,"I occasionally buy bitcoin from time to time and this is the first time I’ve used coinbase as a bitcoin wallet. Since I don’t have a credit or debit card being at a young age, I decide to use a separate exchange, Paxful , which lets me buy bitcoins with gift cards. I transferred my bitcoins to coinbase thinking it was a good wallet, but I was complete wrong. What ended up happening was the transfer from paxful to coinbase took about an hour longer than the stated time to transfer only about 17 dollars when in reality it should only take about 2 minutes. When my coinbase wallet was funded, I tried to send them out for a transaction and was greeted with the lovely message saying that I “did not have enough funds to complete to transaction” when I only tried to send 5 dollars from my account, therefore locking me from my bitcoins. Coinbase in a nutshell is a company composed of thieves. When you buy from them or use them as a wallet, they do every scummy thing in the book to take your money. Coinbase is a terrible bitcoin exchange to buy and store your bitcoins with."
coinbase,ios,Turbo2252,1,2021-12-18 02:58:02,"There hasn’t been one update lately that actually helps your clients. For example you removed the charts for almost every screen to make your users have a harder time figuring out how a crypto is doing that day. You still refuse to hire customer service. Which is probably one of the most garbage ways of running a company that involves peoples money. The amount of people that have problems with what you do as a company would make you think you would try to change things to become a better company for your users. But that’s not the case. So if you’re not doing these updates to help your users, who are you doing them for? This app has become a shell of itself in just that last several months.

Just noticed another update as soon as I finished typing this. Guess what? The update fixed nothing. All Coinbase does is remove features that they feel like can’t help you actually make some money. Basically their crooks. Real apparent at this point."

From there, I was denied usage because of the ID verification process. I provided my valid NJ drivers license multiple times, but was rejected each time. When contacting Coinbase support, they told me to repeat the process and take a selfie. After this attempt, I was told that my ID name (Jonathan K Van Dongen) does not match my Legal Name (Jonathan Van Dongen), which is obviously absurd. They have repeatedly sent me the same message to use the 3-picture verification without any additional support and will not let me talk to a Coinbase support specialist “for security reasons”. So I still cannot use this account because Coinbase is not sophisticated enough to recognize my middle initial in my driver’s license.

Specifically, my cost basis, then most recently pulled off or relocated are my recurring purchases. The ‘trade’ option on the bottom menu has been replaced with ‘prices’ which provides overlapping and less than useful info I can get on other tabs (how is this different than a watchlist?) At this point I have no idea without logging into the browser app how to find my recurring buys. Final change I’d ask for is to kill off the feature that automatically adds my holdings or purchases to my watchlist. I use watchlists to follow assets I don’t yet own so having to unstar each one I buy into is less than ideal."

Both times my account was locked, unable to buy or sell crypto I owned and no matter how hard I tried and deep I dug into their “help center” I couldn’t get an actual person to respond or help.
Even their live chat are just programmed responses that will ultimately lead to you waiting day for support to respond to you email request for hep.

SEVEN emails from me back and forth to Coinbase Support (including sending them a copy of their own aforementioned email that I was verified several times) has only resulted in form emails being returned, responses not relevant to the issue or no response at all.

The manager incorrectly referred to me as a woman after I disclosed my sexual orientation, which I perceived as discriminatory. Throughout the process, I have been assured that my case would be escalated and that I would receive a follow-up within three days. Unfortunately, this has not occurred, despite being told this on multiple occasions. In my most recent chat, I was advised to contact the police. I feel that Coinbase has failed to provide adequate support, mistreated me, and misgendered me. It appears that they are unwilling to take responsibility for the security of their customers' accounts. Consequently, I would advise against using their services, as your funds may not be safe, and you may not receive proper assistance or communication."

They will lie and say if you buy x amount of funds that it will be instantly sendable. So then I buy it and it tells me it isn’t sendable and they I have to way 7 days for it to be sendable. I can’t cancel the order either. They essentially tell you something so you can spend money, they lie, and keep those funds locked into their system for 7 days. They will not help with support even with the higher ups. It’s just lies upon lies upon lies. I wouldn’t be surprised if what they are doing is illegal and they get shut down.

I think that adding these features would greatly increase trading productivity and allow one to see what yields and returns are happening. And maximize profit on both ends….

I reached out to them, they said they couldn’t do anything about it because of a term the have within the terms of service that CONVENIENTLY addresses this exact issue. You might be thinking, “I feel like the loss of funds due to ANY disruption of the system isn’t their fault” but I disagree for three reasons: 

1. This completely allows them do mess with their own servers in order to make the system “not work properly” (or make it seem that way) without facing any legal consequences.

2. The MOST LIKELY did number one because Shiba was at a 3 or 4 year high and 2nd largest crypto by daily volume so it was bound to gain highly (which it did, a crazy 90%+ gain in 24 hours).

3. This is unlikely to be noticed unless something like what I described in number 2 happens, so they can scam everyone on the app if something really did happen. 

Also a few other things to note: 

1. Their customer service is not great, even when you pay for Coinbase One it’s still useless and you can even hear them talking in the background while they say “call volumes are higher than usual”.

2. They are NOT insured by FDIC or any insurance related companies like that. If they get hacked or robbed, YOU get hacked and robbed."

Where is VOC when it comes to major updates like these? Or you just let your product managers run the show to create ‘work’ so they appear busy with scrum calls?

Coinbase Pro was so good when it came to looking at charts or placing orders. 

However, this app is a trash, here is why:

1. I literally had to search where and how to add funds. Was the UX designer intern and not FTE ? Did you guys do any usability studies? Give this app to 100 random people and see how many can figure out how to add funds in first minute.

2. The charts are messed up no matter you use candle or lines. Once you pinch to adjust x axis or y axis, it gets messed up and makes it impossible to read. 

3. The order entry mechanism has been made unnecessarily complex. You have to use the back arrow to change the default price. 

4. There is a lot of self promotion going on on the ‘asset’ tab. I want to see my assets, period. Don’t waste the real estate there with some fluff stuff.

Overall a BIG disappointment! 
This is a serious business involving money. Why would you mess something that is already working, aka Coinbase Pro just so that your product team has something to work (mess up) on ? 

Please escalate this to your C suite leadership and have them investigate whose idea it was to eff up working product. 
Shame on the team who messed this up big time."
coinbase,ios,johnny Blacbro,1,2019-05-14 15:20:40,"I went the proper procedure of verification. Banking and identity. I was clear to add funds, buy crypto, whatever. I was on level 3 which means you can buy, sell and use to purchase anything as long as you have the money in your account. I figured after day one, Coinbase no longer suited my needs so I attempted to close the account only to be greeted by a note stating,  “I have to wait 15 days, before I could withdraw my funds and close the account. Nowhere that was stated. I reached out to Coinbase support, pleading to close the account. They replied they couldn’t until 15 days. I called my bank to file a claim after emailing Coinbase numerous times to come to a solution. My bank resolved it on my end in a couple days. The following Coinbase responds with deactivating my account and threatening to sell my funds in 2 days. Wow! I don’t owe them anything so why are they selling my funds or keeping to repay a debt?  I’ve had the account a week. Worst customer service ever. Their definitely other services out there. Don’t listen to these fake reviews"
coinbase,ios,NYinvestor1980,1,2022-07-27 00:06:48,"For over 3 weeks I’ve tried to convert my holding in Kryll to USD but every time I did that Coinbase prevented me by giving me internet issue and when I deposited funds to see if this was a real network issue my funds got deposited instantly so no it was not a network issue. Also, I tried one other thing to confirm it was not a network issue but Coinbase preventing their clients from converting back to USD, if I tried to convert my kryll to any other crypto Coinbase trades it let me do it instantly. If more of you are experiencing the same thing I think we should be looking to take legal action against Coinbase.  The link you want me to use I’ve used it and all I got was another basic link and a troubleshoot with no resolution to the problem get a real person on a phone and try to resolve this issue this is not a few bucks product that’s not working we are talking about peoples investments in thousands and all you guys have is a messaging service to resolve these type of issue’s?"
coinbase,ios,Jim Frenowsky,4,2021-12-08 16:01:22,"Overall great app in basically every way you could ask for. My only complaint is I have whiplash from all of the UI updates. Today it changed for, I believe, the fourth time in 2021. And all these updates ever change is that they remove the little chart preview on the asset tile that you can see before you click to open it. And then within a few weeks it’s back again. Just decide—I don’t care what you do, just decide lol. It’s extremely disorienting to have UI change this often, and it’s unprecedented for an application that has this high a profile.

Also, this UI update shortened the watchlist to 4 and put a “view more” button there instead of allowing you to scroll through your watchlist. In what way could that be viewed as an improvement?"
coinbase,ios,Hephaestus20,5,2018-10-03 21:08:08,"DO NOT buy crypto on Coinbase under no circumstances.  It is now become more useless and obsolete.  With instant buy with just a few hundred bucks they now hold your crypto for about 5 days. Not only you pay higher fee but can also result is massive loss.  ACH transfer take 1-2 days. Wire transfer take 2-3 days. Instant buy with Coinbase now hold your coin for about 5 days. To make the matter worse.  I transferred some BTC from other account to then deposit into GDAX to convert to ETHER but they clump that deposit into
My just recent instant guy ETHER and restrict withdrawal as well. What a piece of junk!!! Buy from Coinbase now very risky because they hold your coin 4-7 days which can result in massive loss if market crash.  Their supportive staff are mindless drones and will keep telling you the same answer over and over again.  No help!!!"
coinbase,ios,Sam-antha0988,1,2021-02-19 12:23:20,I’m new to crypto and some people told me to use Coinbase. So I figured I would give it the good ol college try. So I downloaded it tuesday.  Verified my savings (which the wife didn’t like) so then I verified my checking and deleted my savings.  bought $300 worth of crypto with my checking and it was all good. So Thursday morning I bought another $40 worth and then Thursday night I get an e mail saying there was something wrong with my bank account. Looked at my account and they took the money out already which was good but weird. So I tried to verify my account again and it won’t let me. Says there’s a connection problem and I try to verify it again and it says I have maxed out my attempts to verify and to try again in 7 days. I wanted to put another $200 in today but I can’t because I can’t add an account. Idk if it’s a glitch or what is going on. So i sent them a e mail since that’s the only way you can get ahold of them. Waiting for a response and all I wanted to do was add more money. 😡
coinbase,ios,Eric21221,1,2018-01-28 08:17:03,"Easy to use but they charge excessive fees. Also defeats the purpose of Bitcoin because they are basically the “bank”. Many other options out there. If you send Bitcoin to an address that they don’t like or feel you should transact with, they close your account, hold your funds and then after a while you can send them to another Bitcoin wallet.

Why are they tracking and analyzing where you send your Bitcoin? I know they have to do verification and prevent fraud/illegal activity since you can fund with a bank account or credit card. But send BTC to an address they flag as violating their TOS and you’re out. Even if you send BTC to a friend or someone else who has sent BTC to one of their flagged addresses and you’re out. Their not only tracking who you send/receive BTC to but also who your sender/receiver has transacted with. If you do use them to buy BTC, transfer it out of there as soon as you can. You don’t own the private key to the wallet, it’s stored on their servers and they log and track every move you make."

Tells me invalid card, so I tried to buy 1.25 share and It let me. Had to go through the maze to get to chat, get there and if you ask any questions deviating from FAQ it just ends the chat and asks how it was. Long story short, bank is verified, card is verified and they had no problem taking my money, but when it came for them to pay me, literally only popped up invalid and no other options than to abandon my money.

Easy set-up, easy execution, easy, easy, easy. 
For a long while, I had hesitated (for a myriad of reasons) to buy into crypto. 
After doing more digging, research and reading (personally recommend “Bitcoin Billionaires” for a fun Bitcoin / crypto broad strokes overview/explanation), I joined the mass movement…like a skeptical and inexperienced swimmer testing the ocean w her toe. 
Since I was not planning on becoming a crypto genius (i.e., willing to spend only minimal time/effort), I reviewed options and ultimately downloaded Coinbase. Friends of mine registered for other platforms around the same time. Side by side comparison and returns: for managing my modest approach to crypto, Coinbase exceeds my needs. 
Some of my friends with other platforms have expressed extreme frustration with lagging transition times and limitations of their chosen platforms. . . But, they may be attempting more complex transactions than me? Perhaps they’d have the same issues w Coinbase? …
So far, I love how simple this app makes crypto transactions. Couple clicks and done, and my relative return seems on par w others who got in at the same time, so I take that to mean, less effort and same results = a positive review."
coinbase,ios,Gmpact,1,2025-02-12 04:57:05,"I have been a loyal Coinbase customer for years, consistently purchasing and managing cryptocurrency through their platform without issue. However, recently, I found myself suddenly blocked from buying and sending crypto—without any clear explanation or justification. Despite reaching out for clarification, I have received vague, unhelpful responses that do not address the core issue. This lack of transparency and arbitrary restriction on my funds feels like outright fraud. At this point, I feel like I am being robbed, with no recourse or clear path to resolve the situation. A financial platform handling digital assets must be trustworthy, reliable, and communicative. Unfortunately, Coinbase has failed in all three areas. I strongly caution anyone considering using this platform—your funds are at risk of being frozen without reason, and customer support offers little to no assistance. Until Coinbase takes accountability and provides clear, fair resolutions to such issues, I cannot recommend them to anyone!"
coinbase,ios,goobermensch,1,2024-03-08 16:54:37,I am an IT expert who spends most days programming for upwards of 10 hours. I have been using coinbase since early 2014. It was a pleasure to use coinbase back then. Now I don't trust them to hold $1 of my funds. They are incredibly incompetent. You cannot even talk to a real support agent even when you have 6 figures in an account with them. They will not let you speak to a real person if you have an issue (and YOU WILL EVENTUALLY HAVE AN ISSUE). They have gone so far down hill it really saddens me to see. The app crashes frequently when crypto is booming so you can't sell or buy. The incompetence it takes to have that happen is astounding (from a systems engineer prospective). This leads me to not trust them with holding digital assets. I am genuinely worried a mistake could be made at the tech level to lose massive amounts of user funds. Therefore I stay away. Just a warning from a long time now ex-customer. Look for an exchange that will have at least a hair of respect for you.
coinbase,ios,stevenmcbeaven,2,2023-06-13 15:58:05,"Frustrating how many issues I have had with the Coinbase Card rewards and the issues never get resolved even after contacting support. Support just opens a ticket, and quietly forgets and ignores the request. I've had multiple transactions that say they paid out the reward but never actually did, and a couple that are months old that took the money for the transaction but the reward state is stuck in pending. It's not exactly the app's fault, and overall CB is a good fiat on off ramp for US citizens, but support is basically non existent. The interface of the app is slightly annoying. Should be able to customize the layout to what we use the most, and whenever I need to input 2 factor auth it opens a web view, auto focuses the input, and immediately the input is no longer active so I have to touch the input again.

I called Coinbase support on 9/12 since I was not able to access my account and they told me all the crypto I invested in my account were sold and someone added a debit card to withdraw funds out. Coinbase support is HORRIBLE. I have tried reaching out to CEO, tried escalating as much as I can but Coinbase is taking no responsibility. As a publicly traded company and a company which I pay a service fee for each transaction, I cannot believe their response. If you lost your savings wouldn’t you expect a company try to find the source and provide some type of response / call from management taking responsibility for their actions? No such response here. I will never invest in crypto through Coinbase again. I strongly DO NOT recommend this platform. I am a verified user who had an account for 3 years until today."

It is honestly great, simple easy to use. One thing I wish they would add is something like what robinhood has where in the portfolio you can choose either to display the last price, percent change, total returns. That would be helpful instead of having to manually click each crypto and see how much I originally spent on it vs what it is at now. Also..... and I can not stress this enough, can we please get DARK MODE. Robinhood has one and so do many other apps. My eyes can’t take it. So yea overall, great app.

Edit: They finally added dark more. Now my eyes won’t feel like I stared at the sun for too long."

However, DO NOT USE THE VAULT OF ANY KIND. If you like quick trades do not use the vault. They lack telling you that it takes 48+ hours to withdraw your coins back into your exchange wallet to sell/convert. Completely ruins your advantage in the market because the market could drop in 48+ hours. I put the plus because it was much longer and after a certain point they just stopped updating me. Updates are sparse, leave you hanging and don’t count down. I had 1.25 ETH ($830 USD) and couldn’t do a thing with it in the meantime, stressing the whole time.

Another problem is the fact that no safeguards are in place to prevent one from sending coins from a wallet to a different wallet without warnings.  For example if you send bitcoin cash from coinbase to yobit.  There is a very big problem and coinbase does not care to help.  Thats wrong, and very bad because money is being stolen/lost/misplaced.  Many have researched into this and there are ways to et those funds back.  But untill you guys care to help here at coinbase nothing can be done unless one started a class action lawsuit and put a lean on all your assets and funds!  Hope these things get worked out.  Hate seeing people lose money they rightfully deserve.  One star only until that gets fixed and my $500+ of bitcoincash get returned!  4 stars if you guys fix your problems.

A completely awful experience.

Update:  Got a response from customer service.  “Follow these steps...”  The very first step was to follow a link to their site to complete some form.  I have no idea what that was supposed to be because the link doesn’t work, sending me instead to the page that just tells me my account has been closed.  Fortunately, on that page I was able to transfer my money back out of the account to my bank, so I’m getting out and never looking back.

This company is not worthy of your trust.  Give them your money at your peril.  I’m just glad this happened before I had a bunch of assets tied up in their system."

No longer is it confusing and time consuming to figure out how to use a defi currency, like bitcoin or ethereum tokens. But, to all individuals who truly want to seek the benefits of defi, remember to only use Coinbase as a “set of training wheels”.  It’s crucial to learn how to store and spend your crypto on your own hard wallet, and or digital wallet. That’s no to say Coinbase should be let go completely. It will remain an efficient tool to spend and store small amounts of ones wealth. As well, having multiple crypto wallets is a great way to protect your digital wealth.

Sure “shouldn’t have invested” and luckily I haven’t really needed it but I’m here to hopefully warn noobs from trapping themselves..in reality they should pay me interest on the money they have withheld, but that won’t happen. I’m just hoping I get my money back at all at this rate...I would advise any new person to this crypto space (I’ve been in the game since 2013) to use probably any other service (cash, Gemini, etc) there’s plenty of options - don’t use coinbase."

There was a network or technical glitch when trying to transfer money to my wallet so Coinbase put a restriction on my account. I went through all the steps to get the restriction lifted to no avail. I requested help with the virtual assistant, which was a waste of time. I started a conversation with a real person only to be cut off when they were looking into the problem. They said I could come back to the conversation, but I couldn’t find it in my notifications. When I tried to start over I was told they didn’t recognize my device, even though this is the ONLY device I have used, and then to verify my identity they said my SS# was wrong even though they had verified with it several times before.

I would like to be able to sort by price, name and volume like binances app allows you to. 

I also find it annoying that I can’t just pick a price from the listed sell prices to sell at that price. Since some prices have many many digits in them, it’s very hard to specify my price. I would like to be able to pick from the list of prices that others are selling for and place an order to sell at that price. It’s the same case for buying as well"

From as far as I can tell, the same exact reviews have been made by various different accounts over the span of at least two years. Why would a company confident in their product feel the need to not their reviews? Well because it’s a scam. They have a dozen reasons for why you will not be able to cash out your balance, and will offer you absolutely no helpful kind of support whatsoever unless your account is compromised, from my understanding anyways, who knows if they’d even help you then. Several features on both the app and desktop versions don’t work. Such as addding a debit card, unless it’s just me. I get a literally infinite loading circle (most recently I waited thirty minutes before giving up) every time I try to link my card. Don’t give them your money unless you want to lose it.

It had a slight difference from the regular graph protocol app and I got got for about $1100 because I gave access. I was attempting to receive an airdrop, first time ever. And the darn thing was a scam. Coinbase could do nothing for me because I have consolidated control over my account yadda yadda. Though if I knew I was sending funds instead of receiving them I would not have accepted the transaction. There should have been more signs in the first place. 

Either way. I’m trying to cash out. And you can’t from wallet. You have to send funds back to Coinbase and pay a fee. Then convert fiat currency and pay a fee. When I already paid fees to use the app in the first place. Eventually the whole thing is gonna come tumbling down. And I’d advise others to cash out to not lose any other investments.

Of course most transactions have a fee whether you are buying ($2-4 fee) or selling ($2-4 fee plus gas fees to post transaction on the network) - putting more of your money into their pockets.  They keep ALL the $2-4 fees, gas goes to the networks.  If you get their wallet and try to transfer “your” crypto you get an eye opening…. it’s not “yours” to transfer (unless it is BTC) but you can buy some more - lol - just like a ponzi they SAY you have some ETH but you can’t have or move “your” ETH…  When your done playing their game try converting all your holdings to BTC (for no fees) then cash out or transfer (for minimal fees).

Not sure why, but I hope it’s to bring back something better that they’re working on.

Now everything on my account was blocked.  I can’t buy crypto sell, trade, nothing everything was locked.  Everything that was in motion said cancelled.

So I went on MetaMask finished my transaction, got my money back from this scam thing and I delete and block them I came out breaking even…. Until three days later that cancelled transaction somehow magically went through.  What on earth?   

I got an apology.  But I’m out $3,000.  That really hurts.  In round 1 of this scam I just got totally blocked and could t finished and they disappeared.  They came back I had figured them out and wanted to get my money back and the. Mama and papa Coinbase decided to help protect me.  Both times they try to help me caused me lost funds.  

I’ll never be doing the scam again, at first it seemed legit, then it wasn’t and to get out costs extra.  

Anyways I am told I have an atypical case.

Atypical cases with Coinbase means they hold no responsibility.  They are not going to take care of their mistakes.

The latest example is Coinbase One in which they asked me to sign up for a beta version. I apparently signed up for it without knowing they would charge $30 a month for it if I didn’t cancel. I was charged for two months of the service not knowing this and had not used it once. It took me hours and hours to figure why I was being charged. When I finally figured it out I was then told they wouldn’t refund me because of their “terms of service”. If you are not going to refund users for these type of things and make them run in circles to get help with the issue it is irresponsible to make it so easy to opt in to the service. I cannot believe the user interface is as good as it is but the customer service is so terrible.  It really is unfortunate but this experience will likely be the reason I go elsewhere for crypto.
coinbase,ios,Sean286,1,2021-12-06 11:03:50,"Everything was going well and working almost flawlessly for about 3 months. Until tonight.
I decided to check my “learn and earn” assets in my coinbase wallet. For those who don’t know, this “learn and earn” feature allows users to gain dollar value rewards on different crypto coins offered through the app. In my experience, some will earn you as low as $3 and as high as $10.
However, when I check my assets, I can only see the price per coin for the transactions that i’ve paid for out of my pocket?? Any other coin that I haven’t paid for personally(including the coins and rewards gifted to me by coinbase) isn’t able to give me any information as to what price the coin was when I received it from these reward programs? How am I supposed to use that information at all going forward? Oh, that’s right, I can’t. Let alone, in an app that is supposed to be unequivocally providing me with the proper information i need to invest? Thanks for wasting my time!"
coinbase,ios,Vadermercury,2,2021-04-20 08:17:43,"I’m done with this overrated, greedy, annoying app. This app is equivalent to when you use TurboTax when filing your taxes and getting charged high fees when other apps are charging far less for offering the same service. Coinbase charges a large fee whenever you sell and buy assets to the point that I couldn’t even sell .20 worth of my XRP because it wouldn’t be enough for them to charge another stupid “fee” when I sell. I only put a little money in there just so I can test the app out before putting in more money. They purposely want you to spend more money into their app and charge more fees. To send XRP crypto to another wallet, the minimum amount has to be at least 22. This is dumb. It should’ve allowed me to transfer all my XRP regardless of how low it is. I’m glad I never put much money into this app. Switching to Binance where the fees are much more reasonable."
coinbase,ios,djsumi808,1,2019-03-19 11:08:57,"19 Mar- Going to summarize the whole thing briefly. 

Quick Facts:
A. Been a member since 2017
B. Bought coins and were left in my cb account since then.
C. Account was verified.

Present:
A. Bought btc on 09 Mar and received initial hold for 20 days. Policy is only 3-5 business days or upto 10 calendar days. Like my previous purchase written above.

B. Called support for review of my account and increase my dc/cc purchase limits. Received email of request, decision/reply within 4-6 business days. It was passed 4 days with no response. 

C. Called support again for the same reason. Support reassured that my btc purchase is there because they could see the transaction. and again, a ticket was sent with the same caption 4-6 days turn around time.  Nope no response again regarding the case, nor from any specialist. 

D. Checked my CB app some days later and to my whopping surprise, my hold days increased from the initial 20 days (it was counting down btw) to 99 day hold. No joke. So i called support again, and heard the same old excuses, “we’ll look into it”, “dont worry sir, our specialist will review this matter”.   What a big wonkers CB app process has become. 

Nope there has not been any responses from any CB specialists nor could further explain as to why the hold days were increased drastically. My bank has cleared the charges for over a week now. The hold days are literally active and its at T-minus 95 days till funds released."
coinbase,ios,HomeGrownJones,1,2018-04-24 16:08:08,"Coinbase used to be a great service. It was fast, reliable and easy to use. Lately though I've had a lot of trouble with them since they've been updating their company to comply with federal regulations, which I don't necessarily mind. But I'm having trouble with a bug that's affected a lot of other people according to Reddit. I used to have a max exchange limit of $400 a purchase for over two years, but since I added a new debit card it dropped my limit to $100 A WEEK! That's insane and seriously inhibits my ability to invest. I called customer service and they told me there's nothing they can do for me or anyone else with this problem. Basically Coinbase doesn't wanna invest the resources that a billion dollar company like them could afford. So finally I tried a last ditch effort. I verified my ID and filled out their invasive personal information form. I was told doing so would raise my limit but it didn't change anything. I really hope they lose enough business to actually hurt them."
coinbase,ios,RyanJC87,5,2018-01-01 15:44:38,"If I could give 0 stars....I would! Don't waste your time with this site! All these five star reviews on here paid for or fake, guaranteed! It's good for checking prices on the go, absolutely terrible otherwise. I have been waiting two weeks for money to clear into my electronic USD wallet. They had no problem taking it out right away though out of my bank account, still hasn't cleared for use though 2 weeks later. The first time I bought a light coin it took a week for them to tell me that they just didn't process it and I was SOL. Meanwhile, during all this waiting, Im missing out on a ton of opportunities to buy at a low price. Do yourself a favor, and don't make any transactions with this crappy app. Find a site on the computer"
coinbase,ios,Armagumo,1,2023-05-27 18:33:22,"The app has gotten worse since my previous review regarding ACH/Instant Transfer. 

DO NOT USE APPLE PAY: There’s a chance they will decline the transaction and then drop your all of your debit card limits to $0.00. This app somehow manages to get worse with each update.

The instant transfer option isn’t instant. So if it doesn’t go through — say if you don’t have enough money to cover the withdrawal — Coinbase will prevent you from conducting transactions and inform you that you owe them for the purchase of the cryptocurrency. 

The kicker is that you can’t pay them back with a debit card; it has to be through a bank and connected through Plaid which supports mostly traditional institutions such as Bank of America, Chase, etc. 

I don’t have and do not want traditional banking. So I’m basically punished for it by the website and app. 

 Ironically, the bank account I originally used—which wasn’t a traditional bank and had to be connected for the transaction—was still connected. 

Even with the money to cover the original transaction — they can’t process it. So I’m up the creek without a paddle. They refuse to allow anything other than a bank account, wire transfer, Coinbase gift card or direct deposit. The payment methods can all be added but I don’t think you can use anything with the exception of a bank account. It’s very frustrating."
coinbase,ios,ronhughes,1,2023-03-09 07:53:19,"Is Coinbase a scam??? I deposited money into Coinbase to transfer somewhere else the first time they put a seven day hold on it and I was fine with that. The next time I deposited some more money they put a 60 day hold on it I have no access to the money whatsoever, they are just making money off of my money. There is nobody there you can talk to. That can actually do something. I do not recommend Coinbase any longer. It is not safe to put your money in there. As soon as I have access to my money. I’m pulling it out. Update,,,, so I guess a human noticed I made the comment and said he sincerely apologized and insured that they would look into the account and then asked if I would change my review. Sorry Coinbase not until I get my money back. Customer service just apologizes and says there is nothing they can do. The say it is for my safety. That is garbage!!! It is so they can line their own pockets. Never again Coinbase!!! Scammers!!!"
coinbase,ios,togakape,1,2021-09-03 02:02:59,"I will rarely write a review that is only negative, but I cannot find a single redeeming quality about the App or the company. They charge ridiculous fees which they excuse by saying a pro account can qualify for lower fees (that are still stupidly high compared to another app I use). Their customer service makes excuses about why something is not the company’s fault, if they even respond at all. I have not had a satisfactory response in how to close an account when there is less than the required minimum to transfer out of the app, since I first tried to close my account. I was told I have to deposit enough crypto in order to meet the minimum. However I am unwilling to pay their ridiculous fee to do so. I’ll just keep it open as a novelty and learning aid when I explain to others why in my opinion Coinbase is worse than even the scammy crypto companies. At least with the scammy companies you expect you have a high chance of being scammed"
coinbase,ios,GnosisGal,5,2021-10-12 17:01:07,"I opted for Coinbase because of the crypto options and for its purported security, however, when attempting to link my bank account, I encountered an issue. I contacted customer service and rather than addressing the issue, I was given a link to the steps I had already tried repeatedly (and had described in my initial email). As well, there is a statement on the Help page that states a phone number is provided in the Help Desk email I was to receive, yet nary a one was provided. The email response was dismissive, and in no way me helped me rectify the issue. Rather the CS rep closed with, we appreciate your understanding in this matter. 

If they can’t assist with a simple master such as this, I’m certainly not entrusting them with my money."
coinbase,ios,Cryptoking101,1,2024-11-14 20:21:54,"I was enjoying the app until I ran into an issue with a common problem that other users have experienced in which I could not withdraw my money. After digging into Reddit post from 2019, they are still having the same problems on the app. To me, that didn’t bother me too much because I knew I could still reach out to their customer service team. Well let me tell you, the help chat is absolutely useless. The agents will get disconnected for no reason at all. New agents join and start off by saying “Let me read the chat so I can get an understanding before we start”. Then, ask the same prompted questions the previous agent before them had asked. Joshua Elmer Fredrick asked me the same questions 3 times and then refused to forward me to a supervisor. I’ve reached out to their chat, email, instagram DM, and no one can help me. It’s the same prompted generated answers. I’m switching to RobinHood, they have cheaper fees anyways."
coinbase,ios,Fuzaldrin,1,2021-04-05 15:19:49,"Firstly I’d like to start by saying that I started off really enjoying coinbase. Everything was going great. I really liked this app and it’s features. However if I could I’d give this app no stars. The reason I am writing this review is because I have only had my account for less than 8 weeks and have been locked out of it for 6. I immediately contacted coinbase support and was told my issue would be resolved in something like 4-7 business days. It has been over a month. Since then I haven’t even been able to log in let alone trade. When a company has your money they shouldn’t keep you from accessing it like this. This is absolutely unacceptable and unless my issue gets resolved this negative review stands.

Update: Dec. 16, 2020

Still no access to my account. My initial review was posted some time in October after a month of not having access to my account. Don’t use this app unless you want you money taken from you.

Update: Mar. 28, 2021 

After months of being ghosted, I was finally reached out to for my account to reactivated. This whole ordeal was very annoying however, upon signing into my account, I did see that my investments had appreciated in value substantially. Maybe it was a good thing I didn’t have access to my account, but it is still something I hope to never have to deal with again. Coinbase, you may have kept a customer today, but know you are treading on thin ice."
coinbase,ios,kidkgkjd,1,2020-08-06 11:03:51,Over the past few months I’ve been having an issue with adding my card to actually buy bitcoin coin base support keeps telling me it’s my banks problem.  Well the problem with that is my bank said they have nothing to do with that issue and I shouldn’t have any issues getting my card resolved.  Back when you can actually talk to a human I tried getting the issue resolved but they could not get it through there heads that it’s a coin base issue.  I requested to talk to a manager and he rudely hung up on me I called him out on it and your support team did nothing to resolve the horrible customer service.  The manager on duty was named Victor and Loui both of those guys shouldn’t be called managers at all.  I started getting back into bitcoin recently and guess what they still haven’t resolved the issue I’ve been having with my card and they still want me to wast my time to call my bank just to have them say there’s no problems.  What a joke of a support staff you guys have
coinbase,ios,Khurly,1,2019-06-26 18:38:25,"I wanted to deposit my funds in my bank account but instead accidentally deposited that amount into my coinbase account. Once I tried to reverse it, I couldn’t get a hold of anyone at their support team to reverse this. I decided to call my bank to block the transaction and now that they did, coinbase is threatening to liquidate my remaining assets into cash unless paid. This is awesome too because since my bank account blocked the transaction, they removed it from my account. So I write this review while currently being on hold for +30 minutes to finally put a voice to this company and app. Had they made it clear I was depositing more funds into my account vs what a normal person would assume a deposit for their bank account to be (money back in) then I could have avoided this whole process. Will not be doing anymore business until they improve something or maybe add a reverse option for a transaction within the first 5-10 mins of making it."

When asked to provide transaction history proving that the balance was zero, I got a response saying there was no transaction history for the account. After providing ample evidence that there is transaction history attached to the account and multiple bank transactions with Coinbase, I keep getting what looks like an AI response that is in no way helpful or resolving any of my concerns. This is very concerning and I’m not sure how I can access my account or my money on the account. I don’t think I can trust this platform again."

Many things have gone the way of the Dodo in our fast-paced technological world. Customer service seems to be chief among them. As a final note, I received and email saying they were working to fix my problem. Then received and email a day late asking if it was fixed. It has still not been fixed so I selected the “no” option.

                          ⭐️  🌟  ⭐️  🌟  ⭐️

Good morning, and in. Are I don’t see ya; Good afternoon, good evening, and goodnight!

Wow, where do I start!? 

I’ve been using this app ‘from day one son!”. Yes, day ☝️. I absolutely love it, and recommend all users, especially ‘newbs’,  (new people to crypto) to use this route when purchasing cryptocurrency! 

It’s super simple and easy to use. This app is without a doubt the most intuitive, no B/S, straight to the point way to get started with crypto. 

I am very well versed when it comes to tech and the UX (User Experience), as I develop massive interfaces for entire buildings, commercial, residential, and business, home automation systems. I’ve made user interfaces for every type of system you can think of. What I’m saying is, the UX plays a major part of an apps ‘make it or break it’ Philosophy. If an app is to difficult to navigate, it can break a company. Well this app definitely meets, and exceeds, this. 

Anyone looking to get into crypto, if you don’t start here, you will never make it. 

Get this app people! It will change your life forever!"
coinbase,ios,rickrolled-1,1,2021-12-19 15:55:42,"Does company think 5% apy is life changing?
I don’t think so because most people are scared to  get loans, And at the Max apy % is 5% and only on Cosmo
And no other crypto is their to invest in which could make life better what most users desire is at least 15% apy and that amount can actually help especially when the economy is in negative inflation 
I hope i made some sense that the users desire more because your company does have fees right? No one works for free right?  so do more to provide a broad spectrum to choose from to earn more apy% rather than surviving on 5% apy its just not enough hopefully in the b Beginning of 2022 or before summer otherwise ill gladly choose another platform, i only came to Coinbase because of the company out reach to crypto community which is fading away please offer more apy% more than 5%
To keep on innovating and keep your company stable and in existence to keep on serving for a better tomorrow, thanks and please take action soon !"
coinbase,ios,hongkongphue,1,2021-05-18 12:07:31,"Went smooth for about a month until supposedly my account was hacked and my own money in my bank account was used to purchase more stock. I immediately was notified and shut down Coinbase account and called my bank. My bank was great and credited the km way back right away. Coinbase even tho the account was shut down allowed the money to be traded for 5 days in which it lost lost money. So when they went to figure the fraud out over a week later, they took my real investment to pay the return on the negative fraud investment, essentially stealing my money as the admit in emails they knew it was fraud and if you read their disclaimers on fraud they are to cover it. I honestly question if they do this to many and then just take your money? It’s almost impossible to reach anyone here and takes a week for them to reply to emails. Garbage company, there are many others that are WAY better. And don’t steal money."

I have been learning a lot, Coinbase make things easier for people like me. I started with a small investment when crypto was at its “highest”, even after the market started to “lower” I stayed in because I felt confident that Coinbase was a reliable platform and would continue to grow. I invested in another app that end up going on bankruptcy and lost some money, and that’s why I stayed with Coinbase. I would like to mention that the “learning and earning” program is awesome! It allows you to learn how things work in this “crypto world” and you make some money at the same time. It’s amazing!
Keep it up with the good work.
Thanks Coinbase."
coinbase,ios,garbage!?!$$,1,2020-12-22 14:24:16,"Terrible apps. Extremely difficult to sign up. Coinbase and Coinbase pro apps asked for my ID, which I “successfully” submitted. After “successful” submission, the apps kept telling me that ID verification was necessary, but provided no further guidance nor a link for whatever was necessary, even after having accepted my submission. I finally used the computer based platform, which again asked for my ID, but also a “selfie”. After several attempts, I was finally successful on the computer platform. Please note that the mobile platforms themselves inexplicably provided no guidance in this process (a simple message such as “using the computer based platform is necessary for this step” would have sufficed). 

Now that I’m certified with a linked bank account, Coinbase works however inexplicably buys are disabled on Coinbase pro. Absolutely no guidance is provided as to why. Can somebody please explain how Coinbase allows me to buy but pro does not? These are linked services!

Please note that customer service is essentially not available. They do not respond to emails, which is their only available means of “customer support.” Apparently phone support is only available if you feel your account has been compromised.

This is deplorable. How am I supposed to feel comfortable investing serious money on this platform when I can’t even talk to a person nor can the platform guide me throw any issues that may arise?"
coinbase,ios,Cbrow,4,2018-01-06 05:00:17,"The Ap itself works great, very easy to use and set up. Times for approval for your account aren’t to bad, setting up payment methods are easy enough but do take some time to be verified, upwards of a week and a half. Once you’re set up getting money from your bank account to the wallet will take yet another week however Coinbase gladly withdrawals those funds that day. CC/Debit card however is instant, with a 20$ fee for your troubles. Once you have money in your wallet you can purchase any of the 4 currencies instantly. However if you plan on moving this Cyrpto anywhere else look forward for up to 24hr delays. Ironic considering blockchain technology is supposed to be near instant transfer time. This company has already been accused of insider trading, combined with at best suspect transfer times from wallet to market. User beware"

I also wanted to be a part of the premium membership. The app had no issues with me purchasing crypto, but boy did it have a problem with me wanting to withdraw the funds to my bank. The user identification system is faulty, and you end up having to call to get your drivers license verified manually. In addition they make you wait another 24 hours after it's verified. It's been so frustrating to use, I'm no longer interested in investing in the crypto market. When you call, they send your call to India to someone who is actively using a translator to transcribe the questions you are asking, so there is a long pause after asking a question before the representative knows what your talking about, and even then, they ask 20 questions about something really simple. Frustrating, and disappointing."

Eventually after a couple days of trying different coins to trade with it I found one that was only a 10% gas fee… after I already had lost hundreds… the biggest takeaway from this experience is that I bought the coin on this app and the next day couldn’t sell it, then when I contacted customer support they were absolutely no help, all they could tell me was that it wasn’t sellable on the app in my area… duh… they should reimburse me because I have no problem losing money to a bad pick but to lose money because they wouldn’t allow a trade the day after I bought it… that should be illegal, that nonsense could easily be manipulated to steal money from people."

I hope coinbase invests in hiring more people in those areas. I do not have full confidence in the security of my holdings if I’m compromised on my end, coinbase does little to offer me assurances. If you get hacked then chances are they will be in and out faster than you. You will be stuck dealing with the aftermath for ages while coinbase will be slow to respond or halt fraudulent or suspicious activities.

I have not been able to trade since I’ve downloaded the app a year ago. I set up my banking information added $10 to test it out and immediately after I was confirmed, I was restricted and my account was disabled from trading. I tried to read through the Q&A myself to see if I could find the issue. I could not. Thinking it was a glitch or bug I deleted the app and forgot about it the last few months. 

I re-downloaded it today (months later)  hoping to start trading but my account is still restricted. (Even though I’ve put money in it they stole the 10 I added when I first downloaded the app. Because it’s not there now.) But their support system will ask you two questions and you’re able to give one word answers (convenient) then it’ll disconnect the chat and send you to a message board.

 Why have the automated chat if we have to go to a inquiry board and hand fill it out anyways ? It’s not to better help direct questions to the correct person because you have the option to change that. And why have the automated chat if we’re still going to be put on a email complaint list that won’t get back to anyone till a year later?

coinbase,ios,JB-portland,1,2018-10-01 18:25:04,"Sure the layout is pretty, and it seems straightforward. But the second you decide you want to buy, sell or especially send/receive digital currency, the nightmare will begin. You will be asked to verify your identity no less than 15 times during your stay with Coinbase. And each time you finally get it to work, a week later it will all disappear and you will have to submit it all again. During that time, they will lock you out of your funds and not allow you to send or receive anything. Also, there is virtually no customer support with this company. If you run into errors or problems with the platform (and you will), they will not help you with anything over the phone and they very rarely reply to emails. I would say to stay far away from this company, but you really don’t have any other choice if looking to buy digital currency while also being able to send/receive it. Good luck."
coinbase,ios,tac0mang,1,2025-02-08 07:38:25,"I’ve tried to buy crypto, but they locked my account for “suspicious activity” even though it was my first time. Thankfully I never put money into an account, customer service is useless. They told me my account would be reviewed and would email me but nothing has happened for the past 2-3 days. Just look up what others are saying, many are having similar issues but they don’t seem to care

Update: I’ve come to the conclusion as I previously said, the employees just don’t seem to care or don’t know what they’re doing. I did everything they told me but I never received a verification email. They said that they THEMSELVES would send an email directly to me and to no surprise, no email. They didn’t  resolve my issue or give a real explanation, but they were quick to end my chat with them. At this point I’m taking my business elsewhere, it shouldn’t be this much of a hassle just to get verified. STAY AWAY FROM COINBASE"
coinbase,ios,MrMentalMikeY,3,2022-11-16 13:04:08,"Whereas I enjoy the layout of the page, many functions are difficult at times. For instance, I can’t send a token out. It keeps saying it has pasted my address but it has not. Little glitches like this.
You put in a max purchase and it does not accept when you think it has because once it adds the coin base fee is now more than what’s in your account and you don’t realize this.
Overall it’s good. If for some reason your bank declines a $10 deposit and you have $100,000 in assets in your Coinbase account, they will lock you out for upwards of five days! Even though you have that much money in there, your assets will be frozen.
Yes they have the regulatory coverage of United States were as offshore do not. But, I would use multiple platforms. Because Coinbase can be extremely frustrating."
coinbase,ios,aucar301,1,2022-08-05 02:59:35,"So I stopped using this app months ago when cryptocurrencies started crashing earlier in the year. Out of the blue, I received a charge for a coinbase pro subscription that I had never subscribed to. I had no funds in my account and hadn’t even opened the app in months. I called customer support to request a refund for this charge and was told I could not get a refund because coinbase pro subscriptions are non-refundable. I was told to file a complaint which I did.  I received no follow up or call back number to address this issue. Less than two hours later I received an e-mail saying that my complaint had been reviewed and I would not be receiving a refund. I understand that crypto is not doing so well right now and Coinbase probably needs all the money they can get…but charging my card without my consent is completely unacceptable. This app is not secure and customer service is terrible!"
coinbase,ios,notacheesefan,1,2022-07-21 05:09:46,"It’s all fun and games until they randomly decide to lock your funds up, claiming “security”. It was not my first time using Coinbase, nor the bank account associated through Coinbase. I even used it the day before and I was able to transfer my funds just fine. However, this time they decide to put a “security” lock on my funds with no way to revoke the lock. This resulted in potentially thousands of dollars worth of missed opportunities and all I can do is accept that because “security”. If you need to put a security lock on someone’s account, a simple verification of your identity should be enough.

Edit: I’m an idiot. I told my self I’d never use Coinbase again and I did. Go figure, it ended up being another terrible experience. 4 failed transactions later and I’m still unable to send my own money to myself. If anyone has ever had a good experience with Coinbase, let me know, because this company looks like a joke if you ask me."

I’ve had this account for 2 or3 years, and I believe it is by far the best, safest, and easiest to understand. You can set up automatic deductions from your bank account, or wire transfer money back to your bank. If you want to get involved with crypto currency, and are not sure where to start, it doesn’t get easier. If you’re looking for an investment and want to put something aside, there isn’t a brokerage firm on earth that will take a $20 investment. I think I started out with $20 a paycheck.

2. Transfer holds for days after payments are cleared is ridiculous. It’s like you’re holding my money hostage in the hopes I might buy something more. I won’t buy something else, though, because [see number 1].
3. No ability to choose a limit price. Other exchanges are basically dictating the prices of these coins and your customers are being forced to place limitless orders, which may or may not really screw them over. Limits should be reasonable because frankly, [see number 1] and we are paying way over market value when all is said and done.

1⭐️ because other apps feature superior exchanges with the ability to control order prices, without fees forcing overall costs way over market value for the assets purchased."

After signing up during a promotion “Earn $5 of Bitcoin” by signing up from the add plastered all over my social media, and after verifying my account by naively soliciting my personal information to this “accredited” trading platform, my account was immediately suspended for no provided reason, other than an email notification telling me my account was deleted. What a SCAM!

I have tried to contact customer service to no avail. I only pray the information I provided is not used against me, or used to steal my identity.

Apparently if you want to convert from one coin to another you need to withdraw to fiat currency. There appears however to be no way to do this internally since you can not buy coin from the cash wallet, only through a linked bank account or debit card. Each one of these transfers generates additional fees—great for Coinbase—bad for the investor who wishes to change holdings on a timely basis. The app developers need to make it possible to purchase coin from the internal cash wallet. Just saying..."

Really easy to navigate the marketplace interface and if you have connection to your network/ wifi this is a real-time application to effectively trade crypto and store it in a wallet that they protect at a 98% asset protection guarantee.  Seems strange maybe the 2% is a transfer fee but basically you have insurance on crypto.  Dope, that used to be unheard of, insured crypto, and now you can have that.  Would you want to trade ethereum to bitcoin? Done in a second.  Wana buy 500$ of doge and convert to stellar lumens and then back to doge? In a moment.

This is not the app for anyone. The customer service is non existent. It’s worse than face book. The fact that this app is so highly rated is a testament to how effective buying reviews is. Seriously, this isn’t just my own experience. Before you even think about downloading and using this platform, give Reddit, 4chan or anywhere else a quick search for people with issues with Coinbase.

Finally after two weeks I was able to sell it for a 40% loss. Then years later in 2022 I tried to use coinbase to buy and send bitcoin. I was able to buy it. They took my money with no problem. But when I was unable to send any bitcoin because they could not verify my ID. My name is wrong on my profile. I am unable to change it. I have uploaded my drivers license multiple times. Nothing has changed. There is zero support. You can not email, chat or call them. They have my money stuck in bitcoin.

I contacted Coinbase support and they essentially said that they can’t do anything about it and that it had to be our fault (mistake on our part, or did not meet a requirement). But we did everything as I did. There was no mistake on our part, but Coinbase refuses to honor it. This seems to be a common occurrence as I googled it and plenty of discussion on this topic, and there seems no way to get to the bottom of it, or a way to prove or disprove you did everything right.

coinbase,ios,Winlogic,1,2023-05-01 07:30:24,"If you don’t mind having your account put on hold (unable to send crypto out of Coinbase) then Coinbase is probably a fine platform for you. 

However, I do mind having my money frozen. ACH deposits will always be put on hold. The way around that is to use a debit card so the transaction clears instantly and you (in theory) should be able to send your crypto out of Coinbase right away. But Coinbase will make up all kinds of reasons to put your account on hold so that you can’t send out crypto. 1st they put a 3 day hold on my account to verify my ID (which I had already done when I opened the account). They asked me to do this 3 times! I have a normal state driver’s license and the pictures were crystal clear. Then once they verified that (again), they put my account on hold for 24 hours stating they didn’t recognize my IP address. I’ve been using the same iPhone for years. I don’t use VPN and I use the Coinbase app. I tried to make my case in a support chat, but they don’t care. 

They say it’s for your own “safety,” that they put it on hold, yet your bank wouldn’t do that to you! Honestly, I bank with BoA and I’ve never had them freeze my account and ask me to reverify my ID or because of an IP address. Coinbase just makes up reasons to lock your money and keep it on their platform. 

Won’t be using them anymore."
coinbase,ios,Is THIS nickname taken?!?!0,1,2022-01-25 08:40:45,"Short version: I do not recommend this app because of the lack of transparency, lack of proper service, and misinformation. I will be canceling my account ASAP. Furthermore, Coinbase charges more fees than other apps.

Long version: I purchased Bitcoin today for a total of $1,000 because Coinbase stated that you could send up to $1,000 per day instantly. It was not until AFTER I made the purchase, I was informed I would need to verify my identity (which apparently I cannot do because I updated my ID today and only have a paper copy that Coinbase does not accept). Had they stated they were going to require this, I would not have made the purchase. 

Their site says they are available 24/7 via phone. This was a lie as the recording stated “At this time, live support is not available”. If this is the case, they should update this on their site. 

I contacted someone from their chat who was equally unable to be of service. It will take 3 days for this transaction to go through since they will not allow me to verify my identity (which is going to cost me around $100 in profit I would gained had I been able to transfer the funds sooner). I realize $100 isn’t much, but it’s the principle of the matter. 

I have spent years running businesses and providing customer support. This is not the way. Best luck to you all. There are better apps out there."

Take a look at KuCoin and how flawless it runs without any bugs, glitches or downtime. Ever. It’s really an app to mimic in this game. They have staking and lending and rewards and also sorts of features to keep their user engaged and immersed.

I seriously recommend making the app a bit more data oriented with some DYNAMIC CHARTS and even SORT options on the watchlist and coin explore pages.

A little finesse and you will surely reclaim millions of users who have left negative reviews based on their experiences. This was the first app that I really stuck with all the way through my many years in crypto and I’d love to see it flourish and blossom into a masterpiece. 

Seriously, take a look at KuCoin and Webull and if you can come close to what they’re doing or even just take a few exciting features from each one, Coinbase will surely dominate and gain much higher growth potential, mark my words."

Now I get a message saying to make sure I verified my identity again and that my account didn’t meet the criteria either duplicate accounts or fake accounts. Well considering I know I have neither I am at a loss of course it seems that may be something that’s just mentioned regardless. Clearly I can’t actually get help from a real person considering I have received the same email 3+ times for the same issue. Perhaps it’s something that is done on purpose that way you get out of having to reward people unless they cause a scene about it. Don’t advertise something you don’t want to enforce.

The claim resolution time is 5 days, so between each response, provided that they don’t resolve your issue the first time, it can take 20 days for your problem to be resolved.  In the meantime, your assets’ value can deteriorate while you are still waiting for a resolution.

The app leaves a ton to be desired in the areas of tax reporting, understanding profits/losses, documenting buying/selling fees (which are tax deductible, but you better write them down bc they are recorded nowhere after the initial purchase/sale), and some basic and advanced chart analytics (like volume, highs/lows, etc.)

They are king and on top here in the US, but this space is ripe for disruption if a competitor launch in more fully featured exchange app that was blessed off by SEC and regulators. I hope Coinbase continues to improve and provide advanced functionality. Lord knows they’re collecting enough in fees to finance some of these suggested improvements."

Which would be fine, if the photo-taking for the selfie on their platform worked correctly. But it doesn’t.

So here I am, locked out of my account indefinitely. The moment I get back in, if I even do, I am moving everything out of Coinbase and going elsewhere.

Then I wished to purchase coins again, I had a very great experience resetting my password and being able to have control of my wallet. It took a little time; about 20-30 minutes to cross reference and verify it was my wallet I was accessing and bringing back to life. This absolutely sold me on the reliability of this app. Coinbase could be the best service I have used in 2020. In uncertain times it’s very beneficial to have a partner likeCoinbase watching a small amount of my assets. Thanks for being reliable.

coinbase,ios,aceNOLO,1,2025-03-25 09:46:12,"I made a debit card deposit about 36 hours ago and it still says pending. I contacted support to find out what the hold up is, and first they tried to act like I never withdrew hundreds from my bank. Then they suddenly “found” the deposit, but couldn’t say why my transaction has been pending for all this time. All they could tell me was keep waiting.

Well then you need to update the information on the app because it says debit transactions go through instantly. This is NOT a problem on my banks end, the money left my account instantly and is not pending, the transaction is complete. Coinbase is HOLDING my money, for no apparent reason. There’s too many other platforms available that I’ve never had this problem with. I can guarantee this will never happen again. Deposit is still pending 5 days later, effectively making my last deposit. Now GIVE ME MY MONEY so I can transfer it out."
coinbase,ios,Lou.2019,1,2021-09-08 15:38:46,"The crypto market decreased significantly yesterday and I bought ETH, ADA, and XLM while they were cheap. All three of my transactions showed as pending but now I can’t find any evidence of those transactions. I believe they were all simply cancelled but I’ve had zero communication from Coinbase to confirm that, so I am unsure if that money will be withdrawn from my bank account. Shortly after I placed these transactions the market began to increase again so I missed the opportunity to make money during the dip. I am extremely frustrated - if I can’t take advantage of low prices then what is the point? I will be doing some research and taking my business elsewhere. The crypto market is volatile and if their servers cannot handle the increase in activity then I cannot trust this company with my money. I have seen so many similar complaints from others on Twitter that experienced the exact same problem."
coinbase,ios,PANDaBO¥,4,2019-06-26 20:59:29,"I’ve been a user for about a couple weeks, The initial layout is simple and easy to use and navigate. Quick and easy to get started, setting up an account is easy if you’re ready to invest. The online version shows your account value simplified into a graph I want that on the app. The app craps itself when the market gets VOLATILE! So if you suspect a selloff in a crypto be ready to have already sold because if a large selloff comes you’ll be stuck with no out unless you run to your computer. The wallet page on the app is nice but I wish the crypto I had money in would be stacked at the top instead of me having to scroll through to find the wallet, Im saying SORT button. it’s a great app 4/5 stars. wish too see Coinbase Pro soon for it’s the more serious traders."
coinbase,ios,WhyseGuy,1,2017-12-12 14:29:32,"So the app is cool but could definitely be improved. If you’re new to crypto currency then Coinbase is a great place to start. It really simplify things...oversimplifies.  

For example, there is information present on your web-based account that isn’t in the app (like when the cryto currency you bought is actually going to show up in your account...I had no clue it would take a week from purchase to actually see the currency hit your wallet). There are also limited discretionary warnings to inform you of such issues (given my previous example, the little as ‘30 minutes’ before your wallet updates is just not true). 

Lastly, you can’t actually access support from the app. It sends you to the website, make you log in again, somehow make you log in one more time and then finally you can talk to a bot that really isn’t all that helpful. Also, if you log out of the app, upon logging on again, you have to set everything again (passcodes, price alarms) forcing you to constantly have the app going in the background. 

My overall opinion, what’s the point of having an app, outside of spot checking prices...which some will argue you should not be CONSTANTLY checking anyhow, if it has far less usability than the website?

I’m done, for now.

***UPDATE***

The app is TRASH!!! Good for checking prices quickly. Beyond that, just use the website."
coinbase,ios,integrity&love,1,2024-11-09 19:42:41,"Coinbase has absolutely no process in place for addressing dust attacks. Their only response is to tell the user to not move that crypto, which essentially means that my ETH is stuck indefinitely in my coinbase wallet because there are dust ETH transactions that are in the same wallet and Coinbase hasn’t done anything about them and keeps giving me the same generic response and avoids answering my direct questions. I called and emailed customer support multiple times and they simply gave me a generic non-response regarding the dust transactions that affect my ability to move my real ETH crypto. Then proceeded to close the case without actually helping me. No real help whatsoever and now my ETH is stuck unless I want to be tracked by whoever sent me all those ETH dust transactions. Horrible customer support. Generic repetitive responses. Lack of actual care and realness. Lack of action toward addressing the core issue and no plan in place to fix it. Don’t use Coinbase!"
coinbase,ios,jamieteague,3,2021-05-26 12:33:32,"I have been using Coinbase for some time now and right after downloading, had no problem purchasing with my bank account. That was before verifying the Coinbase account. 

Subsequent attempts to purchase were declined due to suspicious activity. This does not and has not happened with any of the other 4 crypto brokers I use. 

Got my account verified by sending the required front and back of drivers license, reconnected each account and still unable to complete transaction. 

I contacted customer service, they took a week to respond, asking me to verify my account and this time they want me to send them my drivers license again and “realtime” selfie? 

Oddly enough, my debit card magically started working and now I have up to a $100 dollar purchasing limit, which I will just stick to from now on.🙄

There is KYC, and there is intrusion. Coinbase would be so much better if they learn the difference between the two. 

My brother and a friend had the same problem and it was fixed on the Coinbase side of things, no selfies involved. What’s up with that? Some females aren’t comfortable sending “real-time selfie’s to companies. My brother and male friend didn’t have this extra hoop to jump through. 🤷‍♀️"
coinbase,ios,Theycallmejag,5,2017-12-07 22:38:05,"So as far as the interface goes, everything is clean and easy to follow. Buying/selling is fairly quick. But the good news ends there abruptly when you take into account the worst customer support in the history of the world for anything anywhere near a financial sector. Coinbase made an unauthorized debit to my account therefore overdrafting it and when I reached out three days ago, they still haven’t responded. If their customer service wasn’t a pile of garbage then the review would’ve been quite good, but alas, they need to learn how to manage that end of their application. My unauthorized pull issue still hasn’t been resolved. In case you’re wondering if I’m complaining about pennies, the pull was for $1,000."
coinbase,ios,ryanMM223,3,2017-12-18 03:40:03,"I’m loving coinbase, but im having a problem with getting my bank account linked. Before I updated to the latest version, I would put my bank info in and the 2 transactions would show up in my account. I would put in the amounts in coinbase, and it would only say those amounts don’t match our records. I would try several different ways but none would ever work I would also wait several days but nothing ever worked. After the update, I tried removing my bank from my payment methods and I would try to put in my bank again but since you have to find your bank on a list of banks to start putting your info in, I can’t do it. My bank is a small bank. Its called The Bank Of Okolona, the Mantee, MS branch. I just hope I can get some help with this, but otherwise I’m loving the app."

Try it, you too, will witness the benefits of understanding exactly what you are investing in…You will come to know how the complicated blockchain(s) were developed; how it actually works for everyday people and you will learn what the future of cryptocurrency potentially holds.

I have made multiple attempts to get access to my account. Every Coinbase associate that I speak with is outside the US and they speak with broken English that is very difficult to understand. I have given them everything they requested: my drivers license, photos, e-mail and I am still being denied access to my account. This is the only other way I know to communicate with the public-at-large about what’s going on except for social media, which I am also doing. Do yourself a favor. Do not use Coinbase! When the Trump administration takes power in January, I’m going to make an attempt to get in touch with federal authorities about this issue.  A class action lawsuit needs to be brought against Coinbase."
coinbase,ios,cianrich16,1,2024-09-04 03:46:32,"This app does not have a new user friendly account creation. I tried creating my account how you would normally create it on any website or app, however once it got my email information it only gave me the option to sign in. nothing said to create a new account which confused me since I had just done the email authentication. This persisted and I could not find any way to create a new account from the app which annoyed me as it had specifically said “Create New Account”. so when I went to the website I was shocked and annoyed that it now said my email already had an account even though I had never made a password and none of my passwords will log me into the app. So now I can’t create a coinbase account unless I talk to an outsourced or AI tech support robot for 30 minutes to actually get my account made. 0 stars don’t download unless you already have an account I guess."
coinbase,ios,Pablos Picassos,5,2017-10-03 12:21:00,It’s currently my fifth time trying to buy on this app in a matter of minutes. I just recently deposited an amount of money that will cover my purchase easily and every time I try to buy it says my account is empty. Then when I try to specify the amount of coin I want to purchase it says invalid(). I have taken screenshots of everything that went wrong today and I wanted to upload them to someone on “Live Chat” Option within the app but it turns out that’s a bot. It hasn’t even been a year since I last used the app but what ever happened is very discouraging from me returning I will most likely just withdraw my funds and use another broker.
coinbase,ios,Gamester69,4,2021-11-28 19:46:48,"First, I want to say that I’ve been using Coinbase for years and love the app and have liked watching the ease of use in the updates.

That said, I have rated this 4 stars as I think there is one feature that it would be helpful to have added.  This would be the ability to set an “price up to” or a “price falls below price” alert like you can do in the stock trading Fidelity app.  This way, we can assign a price that we’d want to buy or sell at for a respective coin and have the app send a notification when it hits those marks so we can logon to Coinbase and try to get in before the price either goes up or drops; depending on what your looking to get alerted about.

Thanks for any consideration and keep up the great work guys!"
coinbase,ios,MrArmaniVuitton,3,2021-05-24 22:43:18,"Initially I attempted to link my bank account to purchase currencies; the app would say successfully linked but purchasing was never successful and it would tell me to try another method of payment.
When I would retry, the app would insist the account is linked. After multiple attempts, I reached out to the support in which it took days for a response and finally a answer that did not resolve the issue.
Ultimately I used my card, but it is limited to $750 a time in which I have to pay a fee every time to equal the amount I would do one time if the system would allow me to use my bank account. For example a $3,000 purchase now has to be broken down to 4 $750 payments at around $28 dollars a piece in fees...so basically $114 in fees that would have just been 1 $28 dollar fee."
coinbase,ios,Eternal Smelter,5,2021-05-07 15:59:16,"I am just getting started investing into my future and I do see a lot of promise in different coins. There could be a little bit of UI changes though. You can favorite a coin but not on all pages will those coins rates show up first. For example a new coin just was able to be traded on the platform. It’s one of your 4 favorites but it’s only 90¢ and rank 62 on the platform you will have to scroll to find it if you want to say transfer some of your Bitcoin to it in the select menu. Tax rates for exchange aren’t horrible either. oh also it’s totally legit on the free money in coins for learning about them, I’ve gotten like 15$ free. Not even 10 minutes of work total."
coinbase,ios,EJvdM,2,2023-11-05 04:48:13,"They were bad, then they got a little better, so 2 stars, as it’s still one of the worst trading apps I’ve encountered. Try finding average price for a coin paid, try finding open orders, mine don’t exist, try finding a recent sale… the list goes on, but as a UX designer, I can honestly say, there is no menu access which is bare minimum and no contextual link to recent activity. There is no way to get a full view or a detailed view by drilling in or out, same problem exists across their two online integrated platforms. My only guess is that it keeps them from being liable while banking on your losses. I’ve been using Coinbase for 9 years. Let me reiterate, other than a wallet exchange this is the worst trading platform I’ve encountered, and I’ve given it 9 years. Good thing for them, you in the US have few other options."
coinbase,ios,RhiBCee,3,2023-07-15 21:14:11,"I noticed something odd. Under payment options only 1 is or was accurate, thing is it has that payment method & off to the side it says $7500. The other account is inaccurate b/c I’ve never had an account with the bank listed. Apple Pay is listed as a payment method with $300 off to the side, do those amounts mean Coinbase is trying to pull that amount of $ from those accounts or does it mean that’s the max that can be transferred in &/or out of Coinbase? Just unsure what it means & I cannot find an email option on contacting u guys, so I really need some clarity on this. I tried to do one of the learning reward options & says verification still pending & don’t know what’s being verified?! I want to make sure there’s not been any hacking or fraud on my account"
coinbase,ios,Murfl.,4,2022-03-08 01:13:23,"I only have two gripes with Coinbase after using it for over a year. One is that when you want to convert one currency to another, it’ll tell you that there is no fee however you will not be receiving the same value of the new currency. This is not very transparent and I feel like poor business standards. I’d rather get exactly what I am converting and see clearly the fee that I am being charged than have it disguised in this way. The second is trying to send funds to a different wallet address. I’ll enter the amount that is available after factoring in their fee but it says that I still don’t have enough to make the transaction. Makes no sense. Please remedy these and I’ll change my review to 5 stars. Thanks."

The Help Center is a computer that responds via messaging system and it is of NO HELP What So Ever. None of my credentials have changed, the email advised me it does not recognize my credentials. 
I have patience, this issue is the hard at I have encountered in order to access my account and yet, I have still been unsuccessful. I am not happy by far, communication with a computer, that is absurd.

They send about 3 generic copy and paste responses to log off and back on, update my app and try the web version WITHOUT ever addressing anything I said and not personalizing it at all. It’s a JOKE to them. They said they are looking into it and to give them a week but after a week your ticket automatically closes and you have to start all over with a knew ticket number. My balance is reflecting wrong and they don’t see this as a big issue! Imagine your bank saying you have $50 value in it, then when you go into your account it says you have $40 usd and nothing else… that is an ISSUE and they don’t care. Pathetic! Totally advise using another app!!"
coinbase,ios,Jasper Ash,4,2020-12-11 20:46:36,Coinbase is great for those new to crypto. The fees are a little on the higher side of exchanges but I personally don’t mind paying the fee for the easy to use app interface and the ability to take full custody of your tokens and assets. The Coinbase Earn program is a great way to learn about crypto while earning a few tokens here and there. I would love to see a limit buy/sell option to make dollar cost averaging more profitable but I guess that’s where an exchange like Coinbase Pro and Kraken become beneficial. Coinbase has a bad reputation for app crashes when Bitcoin is making big moves up or down due to heavy traffic. This also makes it difficult to maximize profits when you can’t buy the dip due to app issues. But overall it’s a great app for those new to the crypto space.

Now im stuck with an account, they are holding my information hostage and won’t let me close my account. My fellow customers beware. Don’t open an account that you can’t willingly close. Its so easy to create an account yet the make it difficult and impossible to close. Till this day still trying emailing, contacting support and yet my account has yet to be closed.

coinbase,ios,Yakenoe,1,2018-01-14 00:15:06,"At first, this app was great. They made it easy to purchase bitcoin in denominations I could afford. Unfortunately, this app and the crooks who developed it stole from me when I tried to make a purchase with my bitcoin. 
First, the transaction fee for sending btc is outrageous- over 20%. But that’s fine, whatever. 
I sent two amounts to an online company to complete a purchase. The second one went through in about 6 hours, but the first one (for all of $60) was “pending” for over 26 hours and my window to make payment closed. As soon as the window closed, my transaction finally went through 
During that time I submitted multiple requests to customer service- no help. Just a canned response directing me to their (no) help page. I responded explaining the timing issue- no response. I sent another message showing that my window had expired and asked for my transaction fee to be returned- no response. 
Fortunately the 3rd party receiving the btc returned them (charging me another fee) was charged $25 to send two small amounts and then $15 for them to be returned... all because this app couldn’t complete my transaction and the “customer support” didn’t think my issue was worthy of their time. 
I respectfully asked for the company to make it right and at least refund my transaction fees on their end- no response. 
BEWARE! Take your money elsewhere! These people are not legitimate."

HOWEVER, if you do ANY sort of exchanging or trading, do not waste your time. The fees and charges are simply not worth it, ESPECIALLY sending to a specific address. I got charged $28 for sending $72!!! What the hell is that?! That's WELL over a 30% charge in FEES just to send a currency over. Not to mention just to make trading worth while, you must make over 5% in equity because 2% will always go to them for buying and an additional 2-5% or more to them when they sell your cryptocurrency for a much lower value than the actual value. For example, BTC will be valued at $15,900 and they will sell your BTC to you for $15,500 and keep the $400 value in BTC for themselves. That's another 3% they are taking!!! So really I would suggest long buy and holds and when you sell, make sure you're WELL over 10% in gains before touching Coinbase. THEFT And misrepresentation is what they focus on."

I keep being locked out or random security hold s on money that left my bank over seven days prior. They hire script reader s with no option s or ability to resolve simple issues. There are no supervisor s or management available for intervention or the ability to overcome error prone algorithms.

You will be searching the dashboard of a 747 to make that simple purchase.  Networks, wallets, currencies, other apps, etc are all exposed, just to buy your disk drive from China.

There is a simple mode switch, except it probably won’t let you do what you need.  Useful information, like how much of your deposit is immediately available (while any banking app shows you) are actually hidden away - in fact you’ll get an email saying it’s all available NOW.  Only after you’ve searched through enough possible reasons why things aren’t working and stumble onto a topic like transaction holds do you get presented with the exact info and specific amount of the hold that’s screwing things up - if you are logged in… coinbase knew, just wouldn’t put it on any of the screens.

coinbase,ios,Isaiah Adkins,1,2021-01-07 14:36:46,Please I recommend never using this app (Cashapp is 10x easier) because first if you put funds in and try to withdraw you will not see those funds for awhile while withdrawing they will say you don’t have the right amount but it’s clearly in your portfolio just trust me and never use this app they’re terrible and especially after COVID with no support team or number well there is but it’s a fraud prevention number so when you call before you even speak to someone they ask for information and will try and lock your account screw that I want my money and second the support page would be understandable if it worked but it’s stupid I had to learn how to use my account better from these bad reviews on here they’ll say they have email support on the customer support page but when they answer your email they will refer you back to the same stupid page that couldn’t answer your question in the first place point stated DONT USE COINBASE
coinbase,ios,ebk003,5,2022-05-18 13:20:08,"The app is designed to make trading ,buying,and tracking cryptos very simple and clear to understand. You don’t need thousands or even hundreds off dollars to start there are no minimums or membership fees! I would definitely highly recommend getting the upgrade it’d 1 dollar a day but allows you unlimited amount of trades per day with zero fees.. this is a really great way weather you’re just getting started and want a very simple way to buy cryptos or if your already in check out the unlimited fee free trading upgrade- NO minimum requirement to leave “on account” . Be careful lots of these other lapps have hidden fees."
coinbase,ios,Brandon Aqua,5,2020-04-25 03:47:46,"Ya'll some people are saying it's a scam, but when I bought 3 Litecoin for $90 USD in August 2017 & sold it for $300 after just a few months in December of 2017 the money wasn't fake or a scam for me and now i'm back on it. Are there hold times & waiting periods to get your money? Yes, but we're talking up to a week or a couple of days, we are not talking scam territory here and regardless of little fees and operating costs i've still made money thank-fully even a lil bit with Ethereum too. This is a great app. The easiest and safest way to buy/sell/trade crypto. Don't listen to the negative reviews. They don't know how to play the game. YES you can LOSE MONEY, BUT you can also MAKE MONEY. No risk, no reward. Get that coin. 💸 Fun app especially the quick price updates."
coinbase,ios,Robbro313,1,2022-04-17 16:58:29,"So here I am on my wife’s account yet again trying to get support for the most basic thing this app offers; making purchases. The online chat support is beyond a joke, they give you ever answer from “delete your app and reinstall it” to “your profile name isn’t 100% the same as you account name” but no solution to how to change it and the app won’t let. Phone support is a tad better although they just want you off of the phone asap and give the same basic generic responses. Email support is the most frustrating; they say they found the problem and will transfer the ticket to someone that can help then the next day you get an email saying the case has been closed and you get no solution. And devs don’t bother asking me to amend my review with my ticket number because I’ve been down that road with you on my account and you never got back to me either. WORST SERVICE IMAGINABLE"
coinbase,ios,CazualT,1,2021-06-22 02:09:10,I tried this app and was trying to verify my ID. Unfortunately when I tried to use my phone camera to take the picture all I saw was black. I tried to restart the app and even redownload it as well. I tested my camera and my iPhone camera was working just not in the app. So I tried to reach out to customer service. Instead of addressing the issue I had they told me oh I need to verify my address and here are the documents they need me to upload. I responded to the email with a question about the documents and was ignored for a month and finally I get an email saying if I don’t respond they will close my case. I sent another immediately explaining it was an issue with the actual app. Tonight they sent me a feedback email asking if they helped me. I revived zero help. Maybe the camera works for others but it didn’t for me and when I asked for help I got nothing.

Your exchanging your  privacy for personal data. This is perfectly fine for the users who have nothing to hide and maintain a good standard of financial responsibility and reporting etc. 

Customer service is actually very helpful. If emailed correctly responses I’ve experienced are around a full work day to a  day but never more. 

“The app have some drawbacks. Some banks, and other services do not meet the Coinbase requirements, which in turn restricts access to some options on depositing and purchasing. However, it is very easy to use.”"

I will say that they are a very user friendly app. Everything is easily laid out and easy to read so for that I give 5 stars. But I just can’t overlook the fees and other issues. 

Fees to deposit money from your card, fees to trade, fees to convert, fees to take out your money. Then on top of that I have two cards that I have registered with Coinbase but they won’t allow me to actually use them to buy anything. My bank account is linked yet the system won’t allow me to transfer money. Problems on top of problems for me and family so I’d say find an exchange that isn’t going to scrape as much money from you as these guys do."

My account has been hacked and all my crypto have been sold and the money was transferred to an unknown PayPal account. The platform emailed me about the issue and asked me if I have traveled recently. I emailed back and said no, I haven’t traveled anywhere in the past two years. The customer service provided me the location, time of withdrawal IP address, but never stopped the process. When I called and asked them why they didn’t stop, they said it was too late, the withdrawal has already went through. Than I told them that coinbase is responsible for keeping people’s accounts safe and secure. But there response was. “The customers is responsible to keep their accounts safe and secure” now I am restricted from my own account but the coinbase has let the hacker steal all my funds from my account with zero attempt to stop it. 
It is very frustrating"

The app just had a current update about a week ago December 2023. before that update everything was running very smooth, now I’m currently locked out request-I did verification through email, but the app doesn’t recognize my email address and doesn’t recognize my device I’m using. If you have a VPN, make sure you turn it off to deal with any of the re-signing in but even now that doesn’t work. like I said above when things are running smooth with the Coinbase app, everything is fine, but when it doesn’t let you in, prepare yourself for a royal pain for a few days/weeks of dealing with the situation."
coinbase,ios,Tree quit,1,2022-06-12 11:42:10,"Coinbase has the absolute worst customer service out of any company I’ve ever encountered. Absolutely terrible.

I do what they ask and send the documents, then 5 days later while I also have thousands of dollars in there that are now basically locked away, they finally contact me and say the the bank statement I sent isn’t valid because they don’t accept bank statements from credit unions… then I can’t get a hold of anybody for over a week, I emailed at least 3 or 4 times talked to multiple robots and no agents and that was that. Horrible company, horrible customer service. Hide yo mom, hide yo wife, if you or anyone you know has an account with coinbase I would be afraid"

For example my accounts been locked for two weeks now (after using for the past two years) with no explanation at all. I have assets such as litecoin just sitting there, unable to transfer, unable to sell, unable to do anything with. When i contact support they just say that theres nothing they can do and that the team will review. Ive now lost money due to this and theres nothing i can do about it. 

I would not suggest this app. Theres plenty others out there that dont just steal funds from you."
coinbase,ios,Russkie47,1,2021-09-07 23:20:23,"When it comes to looking for a proper exchange for crypto or any other needs, the most important aspect is reliability. I foolishly thought that, by being charged fees on every purchase or sell, this meant Coinbase would be superior than Robinhood which offered free trading. And how wrong I was. Your ability to buy on the app has been down on a day when the crypto market flash crashed and several saw this as a prime opportunity to “buy the dip.” Coinbase did their part by crashing themselves for 6 hours and counting. 

Not only is that unacceptable, they still haven’t resolved the hold on my bank for when I attempted to purchase crypto… 6 hours ago. According to many others, it will most likely get canceled, effectively holding my money hostage while the market continues to go back up. For those looking for a reliable service, look elsewhere because Coinbase is a joke."

No one haven’t answered all my questions yet. The contact number never works. Tried to call numerous times and haven’t been successful. No one answers the phones.  The trading platform it self it’s very clean and easy to work with. My purchase power limit its very week and I have plenty of funds but I can only buy x amount per week, this system of purchase it’s frustrating. But my main concern is if there’s a major problem there’s no one to talk to for customers service over the phone. This company needs improvement quickly on this matter."

They told me to make a “temporary” account and verify my ID so I did and they were supposed to give me access to my old account and close the temporary account once I did that. I’ve been emailing them for 2 weeks because they haven’t responded at all. After 2 weeks I get an email saying my case has been closed?? I’m still locked out of my old account. Every time I call they say they will forward it to a specialist and that they will email me when they can and now the case is closed without them even resolving it???? Now whenever I call I have to be on hold for 15 minutes before getting hung up on. I can’t get through to anyone now. So I guess my money is gone and I’ll never get it back. Don’t waist your time with this app! If you ever get a new phone number or lose your phone they will avoid you and won’t help at all.

Tried to contact support which takes one to 3 days and each response I get is unacceptable and doesn’t resolve the issue.  They have been down quite a bit and sure overwhelmed due to the recent popularity explosion and uprise of Bitcoin value but come on get some technical help and more support personnel you guys are making a fortune right now you can afford it!

I believe they make the process intentionally difficult to keep your funds longer. Lightning network is the easiest, cheapest, and fastest option for sending and receiving bitcoin with any other application that l've used but Coinbase. Instead they add unnecessary steps and additional transaction fees that they deceitfully describe as network fees. To which the lightning network virtually has zero. Reached out on chat to Customer Service and spent over two hours and got absolutely no resolution. It took the first 40 minutes for the agent to understand the problem as it was being explained and another hour and a half on chat being periodically updated as they stated they were in contact with Support trying to find a resolution.

Once I did that it said “Send Failed.” I clicked on the information icon to learn more and it informed me that my money should still be available in my wallet; however, it is nowhere to be found. I am now 3 days in to trying to contact support and have gotten nowhere. None of their articles offer any solution either. When calling, it says my wait time is at least an hour. I have used many crypto and stock market apps and never have ran into issues like this, and if I did they were easy to resolve. No app that is responsible for money transactions should make you feel this helpless when an error on their end occurs."

Yes they are raking it in with fees, but it’s getting better. Do I feel secure leaving large amounts of cash there in this so called cash base? Yes! But, as with any exchange, only if it’s locked up in an order and not just sitting on the exchange in the exchange wallet. The Coinbase wallet syncs up seamlessly and is very convenient. Only issue I have with the Coinbase app is that there is a little latency with the app when trading heats up but..most apps get like that.  I guess that’s when I should move to desktop and stop expecting perfect touch response. Cheers!"

Coinbase’s rewards section promotes a better informed  community through gamification. 

The app is frequently updated. I do wish they would return the feature that allowed users to sort their assets by growth, market cap, or volume. I also miss being able to quickly see my returns in the asset list.  Not sure why these features were removed, but the app was better when I could view such details at a glance."

Very simple setup, and straightforward with a minimal learning curve. Personally, I’d appreciate if there were a version with iPad support, specifically for use in landscape mode. (iPad Pro users with keyboards would appreciate this, I’m sure.) Tried CoinbasePro and couldn’t sync my account/wallets to it, which I’m okay with calling a user error as I didn’t spend too much time looking into it. I figured “This will do for now,” and hope that someday the fees users pay for commission will be put towards developing the version I’m requesting here."
coinbase,ios,Whatswiththecat,2,2023-12-09 01:42:30,"Overall, I think CoinBase is very well designed and user friendly, but there are minor issues that can cause dramatic change, especially when it’s involving money. The biggest reason for my low rating is that I’ve held XRP for years. I had entered into XRP before it had closed trading because of the case with the SEC. I had been following the situation for years on my own because the only thing CoinBase would notify me of, are NFTs which I’ve shown no interest in, or other Crypto that I’ve never traded. But the moment XRP is opened for trading after the lawsuit ends, silence. No warning, no notification, nothing. Price skyrocketed and by the time I had noticed that day, it had dropped significantly.

CoinBase is real capable of advertising the crypto plight that is NFTs every single day but the moment it’s something I’m actually invested in, there’s no noise."
coinbase,ios,no idea 444,2,2022-04-29 09:08:26,They shave off the buying and selling prices listed when you trade. I have a few different accounts including Coinbase pro. I’ll trade at the exact same time on both accounts and only make 7-8 percent on my Coinbase account and make 10 percent on my Coinbase pro account. I pay a transaction fee on each Coinbase pro trade. I pay $30 a month on my Coinbase account for free trades but it’s not really free because the poor buying and selling prices make up for it. Example: a coin is selling for 1.00 on both platforms. I buy a coin for 1.00 on Coinbase pro for 1.00 minus fees turns out to be .95. On Coinbase I do the same purchase within one minute of the first on Coinbase pro and I get the same .95 on Coinbase even with free trades that paid for. It’s a rip off. They make up for the “free trade” by skimming off the sale and buying prices. Try it out.
coinbase,ios,jk2151,1,2022-04-04 18:03:51,They have lots of cryptos but their data is suspect.  They fee you to death and fees are very high.  Sometimes I’ll show a chunk of balance missing but then recovers later.  Technical glitches galore. Don’t trust your money with these people.  Many have had their accounts robbed. Many news reports about this.  I transferred money back to my bank account. App says completed.  No money was received at my bank account. They told me to call my bank. Not their problem.  Their support is pretty much non existent.  Starts with a useless bot to waste your time. Ask for a real person and get another bot with a name. Call and get support from India that reads screens from a bot and cannot find any answers. Avoid the aggravation. Trades limited to simple market orders.  Exchanges are supposed to be free but always lose significant money on them. They provide almost zero record keeping.  Just tax info on your gains.

I’m currently mentioning the app to friends and now waiting to see if 2 $10 referral for other crypto work I hope it does

Eventually it went up to about half of what I lost and I said I’m going to take the 50% loss and leave. I sold it and it said that there would be a $94 fee to sell. I was like wow. But w.e and I accepted the fee. That put it in a “US dollar cash account” (not the one that gains interest. Just a holder for my cash. Today I try to cash it and it says there’s another high fee to send to my bank. I went to contact them and it says there’s an over 4 HOUR WAIT on the phone. I tried to contact by chat and an annoying bot with no helpful info would NOT transfer me to a live agent. I somehow, after 30 minutes, got it to do so.

coinbase,ios,AlanRodrigo7,4,2023-08-24 16:00:41,"My past review was about being frustrated with the lack of customer service. I moved to a different state and changed my number, so there was a time I couldn’t sign in to my account. I tried calling but couldn’t talk to a human representative. Sending an e-mail to Coinbase support was a process, and the first few responses seem like if it was automated by a bot. I was able to respond to one of the e-mails and express my frustration. I finally got responses from Coinbase support vía e-mail. They gave me 2 methods and 1 worked. I finally have access to my account again. 
Other than that, Coinbase is easy to use. It’s good for people starting out. The fees are a bit high in my opinion. They definitely take security seriously."
coinbase,ios,macgt3,1,2022-11-10 19:52:49,"Each time after logging in, I’m kicked out and asked to log in again. Using latest iPhone 14 Pro in latest iOS. Only happens to this app. Other crypto apps work just fine. When I log in through a browser, everything is fine.

Update: Dev responded and told me to delete the app, which I did. Then, I was able to log in. All was good. Couple days later, the app asked me to log in again. And now it’s the same problem again - it logs in and kicks me out. So I have to basically delete the app and reinstall every time I want to log in. 

I can’t for the life of me figure out why they did away with Coinbase Pro (formerly GDAX). I used it via a browser for several years and it was my favorite way to trade. This new Coinbase app and advanced trading is just beyond terrible. Worst crypto app of all. Extremely confusing. I have no idea how place an order or how to deposit/withdraw my funds."
coinbase,ios,bwisc,4,2021-05-13 16:04:58,I love trading on Coinbase so far and have really enjoyed all the resources available but it doesn’t keep you updated on what your average price is or specific details about your own portfolio. It gives you details on the crypto itself but doesn’t specify how it relates back to your account and what you have invested. You can go and look at the individual details of each transaction you complete but if you have multiple transactions with a specific crypto it doesn’t put those together to tell you how much you have and at what average price you have it. A couple other things along those lines exist in the app (hoping it changes moving forward) but all in all it’s a good app.
coinbase,ios,Schwalmy,4,2017-12-10 16:10:12,"The setup is extremely easy and it seems fairly secure so far. There is something you need to understand about pricing though. The buy and sell prices have fees of about 1.5% for all trades on top of the $1 fee they show you. This means when the value is listed at $145 for LTC, you pay about $147 and vice versa for selling. This percent fee is not directly shown but instead modified the per coin price when buying or selling.

This is still a great app for managing funds but with a little extra time and patience to learn a little more, this app is best paired with GDAX. They are owned by the same company and funds can be directly transferred for free between GDAX and Coinbase. Use GDAX for precise trading and Coinbase for more long term trading and mobile management of funds."
coinbase,ios,guapppoppo,1,2023-04-03 23:04:45,i had been trading on coinbase for a year & out of nowhere they put a hold on my account saying account under review even tho I already verified my account and had been using it for over a year. I couldnt access my money for over 3 years I filed a complaint and was in the process of taking them to small claims court. they just unlocked my account today & all my assets dropped in price since i’ve been locked out so i only got half my money back. moral of the story don’t put your money in their hands. I had over $400 in my account at the time & over those years I was out of work for a while and needed my money but couldn't access it. i had to take out a small loan to pay a bill which is ridiculous. I just got my money back & the balance went down to $212 since bitcoin and etherum went down tremendously 😔 i cant stress this enough DONT USE COINBASE!!

Throughout the journey, Coinbase has been improving and getting faster and more efficient since I first downloaded it, and I love the new assets coming in every so often. The UI is also super easy to navigate and very professional looking, I would recommend Coinbase to anyone looking to get into crypto, as it’s a great place to start. One thing I wish the devs would add, however, is a profit/loss over the day/all-time. It would be nice to see how well my investments are doing over time. Other than that though it’s a great app and I’ve never had any detrimental issues. 5/5 stars"

It won’t let me add my banking account (routing and account number) even though I have had this bank account for over 20 years and have money in it. 🤷‍♀️ guess, if I do put in any money,It won’t be more than $100. Looks like people are having trouble with drawing. Surprising with all the good reviews. Perhaps at some thing I’m doing incorrectly, but I refuse to use Plaid. Even if Coinbase does not store that information, Plaid will have it, even if only for a brief moment and it’s encrypted. Nope. Perhaps someone can share their experience? If so and a test of a small amount works and they let me withdraw, I will update my review."

However, if (more like WHEN) you experience any issues (app bugs, system errors, unexplained account suspensions/restrictions all for absolutely no reason) Coinbase support only has a phone line for their card holders and that is it. You’re sole point of contact is a form online and hoping they get back to you within the month while all of your assets are frozen!! 

Start with Kraken or Gemini and save yourself the hassle later down the road. Everyone that has this problem has switched exchanges, however Coinbase makes this very hard for you to transfer funds (system error, application bug). So once you’re on Coinbase..you’re pretty much stuck there. AVOID AT ALL COST"

Since their system has misread my age and my name and disabled trading. It deleted my limit orders and have since missed out on several opportunities for good profits and have to hope the price doesn’t crash down again. Their support center took 4 days to escalate the situation and are now saying it will take at least 5-7 business days, maybe longer for the specialist to look at it. The Coinbase pro exchange itself is pretty good with low fees and good charting, just hope you never have an issue you want fixed in a timely manner.
*Update*
I’d verified finally. I have full access on the Coinbase brokerage but trading is still disabled on Coinbase pro. Every few days they tell me the issue is fixed when it is not. I notify them and they tell me it will be a few days more. Over a week of missed profits. Worst customer service ever."
coinbase,ios,Nate Allen,1,2017-12-28 20:56:59,"I used this app to invest a couple weeks ago. I invested almost $600 in bitcoin. I am a recent finance graduate and I knew bitcoin would go up in value for another week or so before crashing.

About a week and a half after I initially purchased, bitcoin began declining extremely rapidly. I tried to sell, as I had made a pretty good profit.

But as it turns out, Coinbase STILL HADN’T PROCESSED MY TRANSACTION. It said it was still “pending” because I used a bank account, not a card. It won’t let me sell. It’s been another week, and bitcoin has now dropped from $19,000 to $12,000, and I am STILL unable to sell. I am being forced to lose about $300 at this rate until my transaction goes through.

The very nature of the bitcoin market is that it’s a short term investment. Therefore, there is absolutely no reason it should take Coinbase 10 business days to process a transaction. At this rate, there’s a good chance I will lose over $300. 

Last thing: When you buy bitcoin, the price is always automatically inflated about 3% higher from what the graph represents. It won’t tell you the inflated price until after you select your payment method and amount, and then the price is magically higher. Conversely, the price deflates from the “current price” on the graph by about 3% every time you sell! Added up, that’s cutting into your profits by about 6%. Significant!!"
coinbase,ios,D-vizzal,5,2017-10-27 13:34:38,"This is becoming so aggravating because I’ve been trying for going on 2 weeks... 1st my Credit Card verification showed 2 deposits of $1.00, but I kept getting an error... Turns out one of the transactions was $1.99, but showed as a temp auth as $1.00 so not the best way to verify if that happens... Next I put in my checking account info on a Friday. Says 2-3 business days temp charges but nothing as of Friday (the next week). Now I’m back again to try for the 3rd and final time... I get the temp auth charged via debit card and when I attempt to input the amounts I’m not able to click the “continue” button on the app because the keypad is blocking it and I’m unable to verify... 😡😡😡"
coinbase,ios,Tac Leung,5,2017-10-08 08:47:57,"The biggest feature of Coinbase is bitcoin key management that allows the rest of us non-cryptographically savvy civilians to participate in the blockchain. I upgraded all my devices since I bought coins in 2013 then didn’t think about it much again till recently when I had reason to trade and found that I lost my password. The Coinbase customer support system is a little tricky to navigate at first (especially if you activated two-factor authentication but no longer owned any of the registered devices like me). But once I made contact with Michael on their customer support team, I was back in my account in no time. The good news is that I had bought more bitcoin than I originally remember!"
coinbase,ios,Colleen97,5,2017-12-22 03:37:02,"Every time you use this exchange for anything they charge a fee... fine but you investments automatically go down. Then they add Bitcoin Cash, let you buy it but then say it can’t be bought or sold, yet of course the value keeps changing, and your investment loses money and you cannot sell... your money just disappears and your hands are tied because all you can do is watch. Then when they do open the selling back up it is obviously at a much lower price. You cannot sell when your vale goes up?  They want to steal your money like a bunch of crooks.  So, I guess if your lucky enough to have enough money to ride it all out, good for you but from what I see they are just stealing your money."

They will make you speak with an agent and then they will have wait afterwards they will send a link to send proof of that you opt it. After some time they will just tell you that the specialist team is working on it. And that you will receive another email within 24- 48hrs confirming your entry. The entry deadline will pass and they will consider it an invalid entry. 

Each one I’ve done has been cancelled and they been sending me ghost emails with the entry description stating it went through when they cancel it themselves. Technically anyone who trades or subscribes to there Coinbase one was just no use for it. 
Every agent has told me the same thing and leads to the same result."
coinbase,ios,BlenderBoy1,1,2021-09-08 14:07:28,"I re-funded my account for the first time in about 3 years today with $500. I had to re-link my bank account which went smoothly but when trying to purchase $500 of Cardano I received a message that they’re experiencing connection issues and to close the app and try again. I did that twice and after the third attempt was successful I found out that I now owned $1500 of Cardano and got hit with transaction fees that I should’ve never been charged. An email from them was a general form email. It’s only about $30 but how often does this happen? I trade with TD Ameritrade and they compensate for their mistakes.
Nothing has been done. I received an email on September 7 that they closed my case. They also will not release the almost $500 that is in my cash account that has been on hold for nearly a week. Coinbase has handled this very unprofessionally for a publicly traded company."
coinbase,ios,TrebleMusic,3,2021-06-01 00:30:07,"The app is fine. It’s extremely annoying that every couple days it seems to reset my preference to allow me to sign in with a pin or Face ID and therefore have to go through the entire authentication process again. If you need to contact support, good luck. They have a bot and it will eventually direct you to a contact us page if you ask for a human but the contact us page does not actually have a way for you to do so. Just another automated process where you input what your issue is based on different drop down menus and then “solutions” are provided. Seriously considering closing out my accounts this week because I don’t need to waste my time with a company that can’t figure out basic customer service."
coinbase,ios,LogicLuminary,1,2021-05-21 01:15:51,"Definitely one of the worst apps in the App Store. They saved themselves a little money by not supporting the iPad in any form or fashion unless you count a little rectangle sitting in the middle of the screen a workable solution. Setting up an account will require in the order of six to eight SMS messages with  new passwords that you better don’t dare to get mixed up. Fun fact: every second one of those messages won’t be delivered and then you get a note to please use another app to verify the coin base app. Every time you want to log into the app it’s  another SMS plus it’s failure plus a retry and maybe you get in. Just logging in doesn’t work. Most of the time you will see an alert telling you to try again in a couple of hours. And that is before you give them any money and trust them with your bank details. Oh, and absolutely no customer support. Yup. Crappy app, crappy service."
coinbase,ios,BrowserG,2,2021-04-13 05:03:56,"Coinbase and Coinbase Pro work for basic crypto currency trading but are missing a lot of basic features.  Want to place a limit order, you’ll have to do an instant transfer to Coinbase Pro.  But don’t be fooled by the name.  Coinbase Pro is less intuitive and provides nothing in terms of research, detailed price analysis, resistance levels, trending average price within a set period of time, and to trade, you have to get out of your portfolio wallet and trade from the market summary page which is confusing. For market orders, Coinbase, not Pro, is the most intuitive route.  Price alerts on either platform are severely lacking. Coinbase should merge the two apps and then toss them in the trash. Then get experienced traders with project management background to work with their IT teams to build a new robust, intuitive, leading edge platform."
coinbase,ios,12234489017489262901,3,2020-08-01 04:09:59,"Coinbase is a really good app but they really be taxing you on the feed. You pay a fee to buy then you pay a fee to sell. The fees be pretty high if you ask me. Bought $500 worth of crypto and they charged me about $10 to buy then I gained a few bucks and decided to sell because I felt I was timing my trade wrong and they charged me like $7. I didn't make any gains after the fees. Good platform but they need to find a way to lower the fees. 

Also in your portfolio I would be nice to be shown the percentage of loss or gain and the amount in cash you gained but they don’t do that would be nice to add it. 

Other than that it’s a pretty good app and I like how they make it easy for people to get into crypto since I think it has so much potential and would like to see more people using it."
coinbase,ios,1outof1,5,2024-10-02 22:41:32,While I am not a huge earner of Crypto I invest when I am able and have found that not only is Coinbase easy to use but the support they offer is outstanding. I always feel confident in the advice given by their site and don’t find it overly complicated like some of the others I have used. Everything is straight forward and they offer not only great advice but also keep you updated on everything current news as well as other valuable information and I love this. If you’re new to Crypto or not this is a wonderful way to start or continue on your Crypto journey I highly recommend you check them out!
coinbase,ios,Do not use cbase,1,2025-02-08 05:51:04,"So I got a new phone and phone number, I used a passkey on my old phone to login to the app on the new phone I have now to make sure this wouldn’t happen.  So everything seemed to work fine. I used the app bought and sold crypto on my new and current phone then last night I was logged out of app for no reason. And now I cannot log back in. You cannot speak to any real person unless you can login to the app. I have sent my picture of my valid id several times as well as a video and of course the response is that I cant be Identified with the same id I used to open the account. So now I can’t login to the app that has several thousands of dollars in it and you cannot get ahold of anyone there customer service is a joke. If I find a way to get back in I’m pulling my funds and never using the app again I would NOT recommend using this app"
coinbase,ios,Dr. ky,4,2024-12-09 18:21:17,"So far CoinBase is educating me as an investor about digital money and now by taking the quizzes I am being taught knowledge and understanding of what product I am investing in or researching.
     I am also learning from this app that there is a whole new financial world out in the very near future.  Probably 99% of people are not aware of this.
    So listen carefully, do not rush, this app could easily teach you to increase wealth and income.  Do not “veg” out because you don’t understand.  You can take brief course of 5 minutes, then simply answer a multi choice question.  You will receive financial reward.
     Pray and receive Wisdom and set aside some of your new wealth for the poor and elderly!

I continued to wait 17 business days, continuously messaging a robot to check what was happening. Tried calling, 4 hour wait, no call back. I hung up to file a complaint , I need to have a case number (speak with a representative) to submit one. I message the bot to see if I can receive a case number through that but I also have to wait 4 hours and need to send a message or else I lose my place in line.I tried to withdraw my remaining balance and paid the instant deposit fee and also still nothing.

However I just deleted coinbase due to the fact they won’t give a simple $30 refund over their coinbase one subscription they push down your throat. I bought thinking It would at the least go on the card or be canceled before the end of the month. However I was charged $30 out of my United States Dollar balance. I had the membership for less than a day, canceled and can not get my money back. Absolutely ridiculous especially considering how much money i’ve put in overall. I deleted this useless money drainer and advise anyone not to pursue it. Especially if they won’t even have your back on something not even related to losses made on crypto. This was just cash balance. Greedy company beware"
coinbase,ios,333 is unhappy,2,2022-06-26 07:28:57,Seriously suspected fraud charge when I’m buying my game coins back to back and no way to confirm that it’s not fraud is outrageous makes this perfect coinbase debit card one of the worse options to spend my hard earned crypto. SO FIX IT SUSPECTED FRAUD CHARGE NEEDS TO BE CONFIRMED BU TEXT OR EMAIL SO I CAN SPEND AS FAST AS I WANT AND WHEN I WANT WITH A TAP OF IS THIS TRANSACTION OK LIKE ANY NORMAL DEBIT CARD OPTION WITH SECURITY. I emailed coinbase I was replied with sorry this is a automated system there’s nothing you can do about it. This is huge and will be a big problem for many users and until fixed 2 star is being nice the frustration of not able to make 4 or more transactions in 30 minutes with out a option of me securely confirming the transaction is a big deal fix it coinbase makes plenty of profits to have that option implemented into our security.

I’ve always been fascinated with crypto technology so I bought a dollar worth of bitcoin just to say I owned some and to learn about the market.  The first time I bought, bitcoin was around 3,200.  I’ve been slowly buying the dips and holding my coin and I’ve almost doubled my investment in 4 months!  Bitcoin just passed 10,000 and ethereum and litecoin have increased dramatically as well.  I think everyone should have at least a little money In Cryptocurrency just to learn about it.  It’s also the most fun I’ve ever had in my life spending money, Hands down!!"
coinbase,ios,Gf gf gf gf,1,2021-05-14 05:40:47,This app is trash and the creators are crooks. The amount they charge in fees an ridiculous especially with the amount of time it takes them to day anything while keeping your money hostage. If you buy a certain amount of coin to use to purchase something with it will hold most of it for a week. If it tells you you have a certain amount available to transfer you don’t actually have that amount because they are going to charge you way more to transfer it. They also allowed me to send btc to an email that wasn’t even associated with Coinbase so now my money is just somewhere in limbo and they will not do anything about it. On top of all this all their customer service is basically a robot that doesn’t not give a care or anything but generic messages. I wish I never put any money into these crooks what they’re doing should be illegal.
coinbase,ios,Pigeon Noise,2,2021-05-08 01:51:27,"This app continues to surprise me with how much it lags and how little it allows you to do. I have Robinhood, and that app is a dream to navigate and take full advantage of (compared to this, at least). I was expecting to be able to easily pull up each of my stats with a highly ergonomic interface, but I was disappointed to find that it bumbles around with whatever you try to do. Payments are hard to manage, fees are plentiful and annoying, and the whole portfolio section was made with minimal usability or explanation. I didn't know I was paying directly from the bank and not the cash I had loaded it for a few days, and that's not something you run into in a well-planned app. The app and service are not what you want. Robinhood deals with some crypto, and they still manage it much, much better."
coinbase,ios,😳😁😀,1,2017-12-18 01:19:52,"Ridiculous price gouging with $2.99+ per buy and sell, basically $5.98 per time you want to even make a bit of profit, with investing under $1000, you may gain about $1-10, then basically lose half of it due to just buying or selling. Easily gain a negative, lack of customer support assistance, worst software with little to none assistance. Bank verification is obsolete and bugged out, gdax is as bad as coinbase. Expect your funds to be put on hold due to their greediness to not respond to your information, not send a verification charge to your bank, and also make it so you can’t resend the verification, forcing you to go to gdax which wants a I.D verification that never works, same 2-4 week response time for customer service, and also the only response is from their automated robot chat that never knows anything more than 3 questions. Good luck, because there are better ways to earn your money."

Tonight tried to Send 75K now my account is under review and I can't trade or transfer for 7 to 10 days. I was told I could withdraw funds to my bank. Told them I was using Coin base 1 to be able to transfer funds from my bank to my other trading platform. Will see how long it takes them to fix this problem before I pull out.

This is how they will treat you STAY AWAY AT ALL COST because they now control you money and sssets"
coinbase,android,Danny Eckhardt,1,2025-04-04 07:46:52,"The fees are bad, you pay a fee on almost everything. They also offer all kinds of rewards right! , it is false advertising on thier part.

I have done all 3 at the beginning of the year and have not even received 1 chance at $200, alone the 3 times I should have got.

coinbase,android,Gary Young,2,2025-04-02 12:43:23,I thought by now they would have improved this app but it continues to have constant glitches and Don't get me started with their website so I'm dropping another star down to 2. The biometrics don't load most of the time and I think they should redesign the entire app from scratch. I did most of my trading on coinbase and I really wish they'd put more effort into their website. OnePlus 7 Pro with 16 GB of RAM on Verizon & Wi-Fi.

Its one of the only exchanges that shows your average cost for each crypto asset, wich is invaluable when dca'ing and just in general.

coinbase,android,James Kope,1,2025-03-28 01:26:24,"I used to love this app, And the learn about crypto to earn free crypto feature was great however just last week I got a cryptic email from coinbase saying they were closing my account for violations to the user agreement. I asked their automated help bots and instant message support staff why do they close my account and the only details I would give me was violated the user agreement. along with that they make it almost impossible to clear out your account. find a better app, user beware!"

kraken,android,Jason Brooker,1,2025-04-04 17:38:47,The app is incredibly slow. It takes forever when you hit a button for it to do anything. No US PayPal support and a 3-7 day hold on funds. I use Coinbase instead.

kraken,android,Andrejs B.,5,2025-03-30 17:02:43,I have been using Kraken for years and can say this platform just feels much safer then any other exchange. Overall a great experience and they are a regulated company meaning they are available in more countries around the world then other exchanges.
kraken,android,Darryl Nantais,5,2025-03-30 14:40:54,Quick - no fuss - buy or sell in seconds! Great stuff! Helpful backup too!
kraken,android,Fox Inta,5,2025-03-30 10:20:34,You can thank Kitboga for this rating. However it's important to acknowledge the work of your team and CSO Nick. Along with what they put towards protecting people from being scammed! It is also a very pleasant UI/UX and purchasing is effortless. Admittedly privacy is probably not as high as some other more advanced options but I feel the security is relatively strong.
kraken,android,toxic mar,1,2025-03-30 09:34:13,"fees for everything, buy fee, sell fee, withdraw fee. Just use another app"

It got removed when I added money to my account, but as soon as I withdrew the coins I bought to my cold storage it come back? Basically forcing us to have either fiat or crypto on Kraken account?"
kraken,android,James Rame,4,2025-03-25 21:13:35,too confusing

kraken,android,Brian Pullen,1,2025-03-24 17:41:43,"all the advertisements said it is so quick and easy but you have to wait 72-96 hours from the time of trade and then you will have to wait up to 48hrs to complete withdrawals. do not fall for this. It's anything but fast! coinbase is faster and cheaper for transferring, buying, or selling. Coinbase takes 24 hrs maximum!!! that's what this app claims to do but it's a lie don't support them!!!"
kraken,android,Anthony Daggs,5,2025-03-24 14:04:34,better then coinbase
kraken,android,Zachary Marron (Zee413),4,2025-03-24 12:43:12,"Updated review* So I'm liking the app more and more. easy to use and navigate, easy to swap and buy coins, adding more and more cryptos everyday. the reason I only give it 4 stars instead of 5 rn is because for some weird reason the app makes me sign out and re sign in every time I try to open it. super annoying! please fix !"
kraken,android,eric devore,1,2025-03-24 04:45:11,"they want way more information than required, don't do it!!!"

kraken,android,Mrberm,1,2025-03-23 01:03:52,"I joined this account years ago when they were a startup. bought some xlm and xrp and left it in there and honestly forgot about the account. fast forward a couple of years later, I log in and my balance is 0. it shows a withdrawal that I clearly didn't do, to a wallet address that is not mine. the ip address and wallet can be traced to overseas where I obviously am not located. some scammer accessed my account fraudulently and stole my funds, kraken did nothing to help me, no customer service"
kraken,android,Mark Collins,1,2025-03-22 23:25:33,"Worked fine at first, but it is worthless since it was updated. I haven't been able to make any trades since the update. Now it freezes up right after signing in. I un-installed the app, then reinstalled it, and it does the same thing."

kraken,android,Tobias Matthew Archuletta,2,2025-03-21 13:48:53,nothing that I have noticed with kraken is at all unique or superior to other exchanges in anyway thus far. I'm still a new user been using for about a month but if I find that I have been mistaken I will update at that point. but as of now very basic.
kraken,android,Scott Lauren,1,2025-03-21 11:04:38,"Day 1, app works great. I wake up the next day, open the app, and JUST LIKE TONS OF OTHERS ARE EXPERIENCING, nothing works. I cant navigate through the app. nothing I press responds or even vibrates to acknowledge I pressed it. I cant see my portfolio, I cant even scroll down on the main page that loads that has the most popular coins of the day. There are no updates. I uninstalled and reinstalled and it started to work. less than 5 minutes later its unresponsive yet again. FIX YOUR APP."

kraken,android,Greg Phillips,5,2025-03-21 08:52:22,"I have very little experience, but this platform is easy to use and understand...mostly !!! However I do have questions! Like, ""Why is it you give me my 12 word phrase, for an account in Kraken Wallet?"
kraken,android,Corey Fugate,5,2025-03-21 07:40:22,"I have searched many wallets trying to figure out which wallet will allow you to swap to tokens such as Ton , just to name one, and Kraken had em' all! Great wallet... a must have!"
kraken,android,Joseph Saylor,1,2025-03-21 06:43:45,Oof what a difference a year makes! This app used to be pretty decent but now it's brutally slow and unresponsive. Kraken has also become loaded down with every scam crypto imaginable. I would be pretty concerned using this platform to trade. Imagine an outage at an inconvenient time? Not sure I could ever trust my money here again like I did at one time. If it's slow to navigate think about trying to actually trade?

kraken,android,Studley Hungwell,4,2025-03-20 10:42:26,"Overall, I like Kraken as an exchange. I am only disappointed with this new version because I still don't get my average cost, I have to do the math. Total invested divided by total coins... it is so simple and should be a basic function of this app! update after reply... I look forward to this ""upgrade"" to the Kraken app and with that I'm sure Kraken will be my favorite of the 5 exchange apps I use now. Thanks for responding to the feedback."

kraken,android,Doge Master,1,2025-03-04 22:03:42,Don't use this app to buy crypto especially if David Portnoy is promoting it. Because we all know he is a rug pulling scammer. I don't recommend this app because they can liquidate all of your assets so if you have any money in their exchange they can literally just make any reason to take your money. That's how they get rich so don't invest using Kraken it's not trustworthy not only do they have extremely long hold times but the app is really clunky not smooth in the customer service is bad.

It's usually when it's busy. Updates don't help. I have a Samsung s22 ultra. Kraken pro is fine Update Feb 24 2025: Last update we saw a whole new interface that seems to freeze less. I continue to update the app regularly and it seems to hold up much better. Freezes do happen and I have to reinstall one a week. So far things have not gotten smoother

I am not able to deposit or withdraw tokens in my portfolio! Luckily the website functions on a phone device so that provides a work around, but it takes more time and involves several steps.

I don’t have to open OKX prior to connecting, like other wallets, to preset anything, I just click & go. I just wish the exchange was accessible in the US. There are too many location restrictions associated with residing in the USA regarding crypto. The SEC needs to take a chill pill! So many company leaders in crypto are moving their headquarters out of the US due to the scrutiny (huge fine$) received from the SEC.

If there were an option to give this app less than one star, I would absolutely choose it. I have wasted more than two weeks waiting for account verification, despite what the FAQ and support articles say. They claim the process should take up to 24 hours, when I reached out to support, they told me it would take 72 hours. After following up again, they said it could take up to a week!!!  And yet, well past the week-long deadline and yet no response.
Support team will not give you clear answers – they will give different timeframe to get you off the line. They are misleading potential customers with false promises just to keep them on the hook! Is the verification process supposed to take 24 hours, 72 hours, a week, or a month,?! they do not have a definite answer they simply lie straight to your face? Pick a timeframe and stick to it!
Engaging with support is an absolute waste of time. It is even worse than talking to their bot—you get nothing but scripted, meaningless responses with zero help.
I have been using other trading apps; this is by far the worst trading app out there. Imagine if your money was at stake and you needed help, only to be ignored by a team that clearly does not care.
Avoid this App at all cost. do not fall for the trap, as they are not what they claim to be."

Also they never let you transfer money back out.  They pretty much were the worst of every part and were completely useless.  Never use no matter what.

I suspect this exchange has liquidity problems or has Bernd’s hacked or something therefore they just froze customers funds - how convenient.

Not only they charge 3 times more for simple usdt transfer, but also require you to pay fee in the eco system token, which you need to swap too. But that also has a minimum.

For example to send 200 USDT to another exchange you need to 3.25$ of Tron (trc20) token. But you only can change minimum 20$usdt, so you end up leaving 17$ on a exchange or paying another 3$ to move them.
This is just one example, i can give you 5 more.

Bitcoin, minimum swap 300$, and you dont know until you move money there and they get stuck. 

Simply this exchange is tricky and trying to catch you there, with unfair ways. Very centralized."

kucoin,ios,Cyclophantom,5,2022-02-13 03:34:11,"Been on this exchange for almost 8 months and it’s come a long way. The ONLY major exchange I have found, available for use in the US, to offer derivatives (long/short w/ leverage) and a plethora of leveraged swaps. They have FREE TO USE, IN EXCHANGE trading bots!!!! no API keys or suspect integration. Very easy to set up, and you can have 10 running simultaneously. Not to mention the Staking options have grown a bunch just in the past few months alone. I’ve been hounding the team to develop a desktop app, but I mainly use the web client as a 32’ screen is a lil easier to view charts on, as opposed to a phone😂 A few things I would like to see: - We need order-triggers-order and order-cancels-order options for trading and futures! - Make a desktop app! - The ability to do derivative future strategies (like a straddle or straggle) would also be amazing considering arbitrage portfolios are a thing now. You can currently run a bot straddle strategy, but its not quite the same! Overall, 9.5/10 UI is gorgeous and night mode rocks Coin variety is top notch Want to go short? Not a problem here! 🤖bots! 🤖"
kucoin,ios,SWIFT MELLO,5,2021-12-31 14:42:13,"I had lost over $1000 due to google two FA it was unbearable for weeks trying to get approved to unbind Google two FA and I was getting very frustrated so I left a extremely negative review and KuCoin even though their platform is amazing and they have some of the best crypto to trade early. I thought what’s the use if I can’t even trade my money or my crypto well here’s a little note for anybody this happens to, it’s not KU coins fault, first off when you go to do your identity in your photos remember if you’re using an iPhone it’s not shooting in JPEG unless you go change it on your settings, JPEG is the format that your photo ID documents need to be in for KU coin to use to unbind Google 2FA! Thank you KU coin for being honest for emailing me for telling me that you found my crypto, for telling me that it was safe, and for telling me that I could do it myself all I had to do was read a little bit more and I did and I figured it out, so if this is happened to you don’t give up on KU coin learn and then learn some more you’ll be just fine!"
kucoin,ios,lanceyprance,1,2021-11-10 21:53:40,"I downloaded this app after a friend recommended it little did I know how much of a mistake that was. I put in $50 to try it out and play around, when I decided this was possibly the worst app to ever be developed I tried to withdraw it I’m hit with a $30 fee, so I decided I would rather not as I don’t believe these fools who call themselves developers deserve 30 dollars but I pushed through the hard and difficult times with the app and started to make some money, well today I had placed a future with most of the money I had in there and had set a stop loss for 5%, I got a little worried when I could see that the stop loss should’ve kicked in and it hadn’t, so I tried to login but alas the faulty and horrendous app Dosent let me, gives me errors and tells me I have no positions open and that there’s no data but when I close the app and open again I can see the charts and price of the coin but when I try login my connection just magically Dosent work, my position was eventually liquidated after I gave up trying to login and as soon as it did I could login with no errors and problems at all. This app is a scamming, wasteful and most hazardous piece of technology I have ever witnessed they should not be on the App Store and should definitely not be working with peoples money at all"
kucoin,ios,MattySlimz,5,2021-05-14 06:12:17,"I don’t know why more people take advantage of this app!? It has all the best low market cap gems to buy. A LOT of money can be made using it, and the KCS coin is a great utility token you can earn while just holding a few. If you are in the U.S. just do what they ask of the KYC docs KuCoin requests you to do, you will still be able to use the exchange regardless, the main thing is only transfer in stable coins (USDT, USDC, UST) don’t go adding your debit card number or any of that. Do not listen to the FUD you read here in the reviews, yes they were hacked back in 2020, but have since remitted every penny and then some with insurance and restitution money. Not only that, they’re security has become 10 fold stronger since the incident. It has leverage on all the best coin PERPs, though I highly recommend getting used to the app first. It will take time but once you get the hang of it, you will LOVE KC!"
kucoin,ios,BD9,2,2022-02-13 18:29:44,Are usually use Bybit but I decided to start using KuCoin seem like a better app in trading platform so I went ahead and deposited money and started using some bots problem is the one bought you can only use on the mobile app so for some odd reason it worked on the mobile app so after I set everything up everything was working fine and then a day later I go to check and it will not let me get into the bot won’t let me send feedback Customer Service is almost non-supportive and they keep telling me to update to newer version 3.49.1 but there’s inly 3.49.0 in AppStore there is now 3.50.0 which still has done nothing to solve the problem they also said turn off your phone and reinstall app which I did and check vpn. I did everything they said to do and it still does not work I still can’t check my bot keeps saying timed out . I can’t even send feedback won’t let me and customer service takes forever.  Good thing I didn’t transfer 100k over and put in to mobile bot. Wish someone would help.  I liked the app at first but now not so much
kucoin,ios,larrylevwrage,5,2022-01-28 14:07:18,"I have loved using futures until here recently, I buy in at a certain price look down and the market price puts me down 5-10 dollars already. I’ve also recently bought deduction coupons and have yet to see fees be 100% deducted it truly makes no sense. I also set a stop loss and it doesn’t trigger until the actual price gets there but market price will be 10 or more dollars passed that so instead of the price I actually selected to lose I lose way more than I actually wanted to which is absolutely stupid and a scam! Fix this stuff now or continue to lose people who use this app"
kucoin,ios,AndrewLeeWoolard,1,2021-02-10 12:30:28,"I consider myself an avid trader who knows what they’re doing. But Kucoin will destroy any hope you have. When trading futures, it feels like my trades specifically are picked and wiped out and then immediately trend the direction I bet on. When I place a limit order, I can see the price start to fluctuate as soon as I type an order that would be fulfilled in my favor. I have placed opposite sided trades on a second device and BOTH sides were SHORTED on a volume of maybe 100 coins of a sub dollar coin within 15 minutes. I have screen recorded trading showing how the app practically tracks my inputs since they also know my exact percentages and what it would take to wipe out a trade. The trading bot is also worthless. You pay more in GRID gains than you make no matter how you set it up, and the bots also contribute to the problem with futures. 

Stay away from this horrible trading app. You can only make money holding (unless they take your coin off the market then your holdings are gone too), which I also bet they use to manipulate prices when you’re not using. That’s what staking off chain is as well, hence the lower apr you get."
kucoin,ios,theguyyoucanthatebecausevirtue,4,2021-10-15 23:49:37,"I’ve loved this app since day one. I’ve been using it a long time and they have made thousands off of me. 
But Kucoin is beginning to severely worry me. This is a trading app, not a HODLing app. 
Therefor you need to be able to trade. Kucoin has started crashing at very crucial times. I lost over 30% of my portfolio because I tried to initiate a sell and Kucoin’s network went down for the 6th time that week because it got a little busy and had to do it’s job a little harder. poof. gone.  6 months of savings and trading gone in 20 minutes, not from a bad trade. It was an excellent trade. Kucoin just couldn’t follow-through. 
People are putting their faith in crypto currency because they are sick of banks and conglomerates incompetence and greed losing their money for them. I’m those 20 minutes. Everything is up to date. Kucoin simply is failing when it gets busy and people are losing 10s of thousands as a result. 
Kucoin- fix your problems immediately.
 some of us work in journalism and will end this apps American base faster than you can can “network error :)”
I’ll need to see consistent improvements and hopefully some kind of statement from Kucoin about the problems soon or I’m out and am ensuring  as many people as possible are aware of it"
kucoin,ios,Yellowtail hello,1,2022-01-20 21:52:19,"Beware signing up with this app. They introduced a 6 digit password and I forgot mine. I’ve been trying to get it reset since October and we are almost at the New Years. I’ve provided them with everything they’ve asked for yet the continue not responding and giving me the run around. Then, mysteriously started asking for transactions to another wallet which made no sense. Please beware of this app, I’m losing hope I’ll ever get my money back and hope it doesn’t happen to you

**update** still no progress. We’re 4 months and counting and still haven’t been able to get my money. One would figure they pick up the phone and call. Nope, they take weeks to respond via email and come up with new reasons to not allow me to use my money. Please be aware as this isn’t getting any better and hope you don’t lose money. A developer commented that I should worry and rest assured they’d help. Doesn’t really seem like I can just hang back while my money is stolen with no progress."
kucoin,ios,Quitplaying21,1,2021-10-25 18:41:00,"I felt the need to write my first ever review on the Apple App Store for this. I downloaded this app to use future trading. The app freezes up and will not allow me to execute a trade on several occasions.  Ironically it seems to have these “glitches” whenever I am up profit on an asset. The app will not allow Me to execute a trade claiming “network” issues and forcing me to hold my position while all the profits deplete and actually fall into the negative mark before finally allowing me to trade. These experiences have left a terrible taste in my mouth and I can’t help but think the creators are pulling a fast one. I have lost over $3,000 because of my experiences using this application. (All of my other trading platforms would work perfectly during these described issues and I was able to execute perfect trades on every other platform I utilize) so they cannot claim it is my own personal network. I would be very cautious before downloading this application."
kucoin,ios,etttcc,1,2023-07-01 13:57:09,"I have been trading for years. TA is useless in this considering it can pump and dump at any moment. ONE MAJOR ISSUE, Kucoin charges insane fees. They will take %50 of your profit and they do not tell you before you execute the trade how much they will take. MARGIN SCAM. Be careful with margin trading on here. If you are on the right side of your trade they slowly lower your margin as the trade goes in your favor. However, if you are on the wrong side of. A trade they increase the margin as it goes against you! This is there way of minimizing your gains and maximizing your losses. This is how they make money. So they have a big incentive to make you lose which could be a massive conflict of interest. Be careful on this app ***** UPDATE: Kucoin sees your stop losses and take profits. They will purposely drive the price towards your stop loss even when basic TA shows it’s extremely unlikely. These people are criminals be careful. ALGOS ACTIVELY TRADE AGAINST YOU IT IS AMAZING TO WATCH THE BID AND ASK FLIP SOMETIMES. CRIMINALS"
kucoin,ios,Tad W WN,1,2024-03-29 00:00:06,"I am writing to express my deep dissatisfaction with the service provided by KuCoin Exchange regarding my recent attempt to withdraw funds from my account. I encountered an issue where I was asked to verify my identity and location, after which I was informed that withdrawals are not allowed in my region.I find this situation unacceptable as it implies a lack of transparency and raises concerns about the security of my funds. It feels like a deliberate attempt to prevent me from accessing my money, which is extremely concerning and borders on scamming.I request an immediate resolution to this matter and urge KuCoin to reconsider its policies to ensure that all users, regardless of their location, are able to access and withdraw their funds without unnecessary obstacles. Failure to address this issue promptly will force me to seek alternative platforms for my cryptocurrency transactions.I hope for a swift and satisfactory resolution to this matter."
kucoin,ios,Tarkkus,4,2022-05-20 05:05:17,"Great app, use it daily. But could improve on (SPEED) and remove 3 second ads when opening the app. And mainly please add (% CHANGE )on the coins holding and portfolio so it could be seen it quickly, and in order when scrolling through the holdings. Instead of opening each coin and pair to see daily % change.

Also when using futures, it’s takes a while to submits orders, and sometimes the position disappears for few seconds until close out the app or refresh. 
And seems when placing a market buy or sell, it always executed at the highest price or lowest prices then jumps back to the price not in your favor."
kucoin,ios,W5552,5,2021-12-09 11:56:28,"It’s good. This is gonna pretty much make me ALL OF THE MONEY. I also like the smoked oysters you can get at the dollar tree so take my review for what it’s worth. I’m basically trying to make enough from this bot to build a rocket that I can beat Elon Musk to mars with so I can be there when he shows up just to be like .. .. yeah. .. there’s nothing here dude.

I deposited a little more than 800 bucks worth of shib like 4 minutes ago and this app is already asking for this review. That my friend is confidence!🎩

1- customer support… it is very hard to get thru and get a prompt reply
2- fiat … if there’s a way KuCoin can set up the ability to accept fiat currency without the confusing and expensive option they recently added this would bring more users to the platform 
3- on chain debit card … if they would institute one of these like some exchanges have done this is another thing would greatly expand their membership"
kucoin,ios,eduardsolo,4,2024-04-13 07:44:15,KuCoin is a good trading platform but why are you guys not answering people’s phone calls have a live chat 24/7? We people risk our money our lives our savings for you and you KuCoin management CEO don’t except us serious! I just lost 200$ with p2p was buying usdt and scammer wanted me to release the money when I already transferred him 200$ so i canceled the order but I didn’t receive my money back what is that how is that? I’m trying to connect to say that I canceled the order why is my money in other persons hands after I canceled the order ? Do something about it make us talk to customer service at real time thank u
kucoin,ios,algo to infinity and beyond,2,2021-12-28 07:18:48,"This app/platform all around is pretty amazing and by far the most advanced of its kind. BUT there has been numerous situations including the most recent leading me to leave a negative review. KuCoin buy/sell/market orders will sometimes not complete or go through. This requires you to refresh the app, wasting time in between your trades. What is the point of trading on an app where I have to refresh one to several times before I can make my trade. Lost thousands from this issue I am describing, and each time it pushes me closer towards finding an alternative exchange that doesn’t require manual refreshing while trading positions. There are lots of bots and manipulation within this app, and I’m growing more weary of it by the day. Closer and closer to becoming a rigged casino game rather than a decentralized crypto exchange."
kucoin,ios,MiracleMage,2,2021-03-21 20:24:22,"I’ve been trading stocks for a while now, so I signed up for KuCoin thinking ‘how hard can it possibly be?’ Well, they’ve made me cry ‘Uncle!’ This is the most confusing interface I’ve ever seen in my life. I wanted to use this exchange because they do have a huge number of coins to trade. I think I’m going to withdraw my funds and go back to the main coins and forget it, though. It doesn’t help that it takes a really long time for a deposit to go from your checking account, through Banxa or Simplex, and arrive in your trading account. While you’re thinking ‘OK, where the heck is my money?!’ (It’s been over an hour since I KNEW where that 10k was.) and, of course, ‘customer service’ is basically an FAQ Bot. I’m 67th in line to chat with online assistance. I’m not currently a big fan, as I’m sure you can tell. 🤬"
kucoin,ios,FlexyFlex25,1,2024-02-26 03:29:55,"I have experience trading on platforms like Local Bitcoin, Paxful, LCS, and Binance, and have recently tried P2P trading on KuCoin. Unfortunately, my experience hasn't been as positive. I've encountered issues with pending trades that have remained unresolved for over four months, which is concerning. Additionally, there have been instances where trades were marked as paid, but the counterparty went offline for extended periods, leading to a frustrating trading experience.

I have reached out to the support team multiple times seeking resolution but have not seen satisfactory progress. This situation has significantly impacted my trading activities and confidence in the platform.

I hope this feedback can be seen as an opportunity for KuCoin to enhance its support services and trading system, ensuring a more reliable and user-friendly experience for all traders."
kucoin,ios,shelbsanne,1,2021-12-10 07:19:42,"Kucoin needs to get shut down by some agency in the US.. everything is done to get you liquidated. My 20x future was liquidated when the market dropped 2.4%… if you do the math, my position should not have been liquidated. It wasn’t due to “spread”. From my average cost to the lowest low on the futures pair, it should have never been liquidated (20x on -2.4% from average cost does not equal 100%). It is about time somebody goes after Kucoin in the US.

This has been a problem for me the whole time using Kucoin. Lost tens of thousands because of this and their “random” log out event that occurs when market tanks. They log you out completely randomly, often. It prevents you from logging in. No SMS sent to log in. If you have positions open you will not be able to get to them. Their ethics and practices are beyond illegal in US."
kucoin,ios,Swurveey,5,2022-07-13 03:25:34,"Love the websites interface could be updated more but that’s neither here nor there. For the most part I love the fast withdrawals and low trading fees and spreads. I’m a Futures day trader so these factors are always important. The only  problem I do have is Futures 2.0 is rolling out and we still aren’t able to set multiple take profit or stop orders in one trade, I think the serious would traders would love that feature binance has it and works really well not top compare the two but I think it’s also a needed function."
kucoin,ios,444 Zack 444,1,2023-06-22 02:47:30,"After updating months ago I’ve lost the ability to borrow USDT as well as any coins for more than 7 Day Terms. Even when I click 14 & 28 day terms it still gives me 7 day. This is extremely frustrating especially during what was the beginning of a Bull Market. I’ve updated several more times and the problem still persists. 

Futures are the only way to avoid this. 

Also since you guys occasionally ask for feedback about how to improve the app, I think we should be able to see our entry price when margin trading like you can when trading futures... Realized gains would be nice as well since that’s also a feature on futures and not with margin trading or even spot trading. That’s like golden rule #1 to a trading platform. Entry price, & realized / unrealized gains..."
kucoin,ios,yeah... no..,1,2022-11-25 19:01:32,"Great rewards, advanced trading platform.

However, questionable ethics and customer support. At some point in time, their software will malfunction(this is definite). When this happens, you’ll contact support, and then they’ll have made a maintenance post after the fact. I know this to be true because after the first time. I always started checking their news feed(not like you should receive a direct notification, and a reminder), this happened multiple other times and support will always just reply with the post that was after the fact. 

So, you’re out of a considerable sum; your trading volume is consistently 100k+ a month; you’d think that they’d be happy to make things right. No, the support people are glorified FAQ’s. They’ll send your info off to another team. That team will not read anything and respond something that’s not even relevant to the issue at hand. You’ll reply to said email because it’s a support conversation. They’ll never respond a second time. They will never fix problems they create. They will essentially steal your money with poorly timed system failures and cover ups.  

Love what it could be, not what it is."
kucoin,ios,HgrayO,2,2021-04-01 01:05:36,"I’ve tried several crypto trading platforms and I have a lot to praise KuCoin for but it’s overshadowed by the lack of customer support I’ve experienced. I am new to the app and wasn’t aware that you need a “trading password” to invest in anything. I have no idea what this trading password is (i never made one) and when I ask them to reset it, they don’t accept the photos and information that they require to verify my account. They continue to tell me the reset attempt failed and then ask me to resubmit the info. Beyond frustrated. The trade I wanted to make is already up 50% and days later no one has reached out to provide a solution to the issue. I really hope they revamp their systems soon because they will continue to lose valuable customers."

Their futures allow for an actual proper stop loss and take profit which is essential if you ever want to be a successful trader. HOWEVER. Trading crypto is by far the worst thing you can do for trying to become profitable. Low liquidity and ABYSMAL market structure you will never be able to constantly trade. I hope this will save someone out there from making horrible financial decisions and if you want to trade, find an index or precious metal to trade. You will be WAY better off."
kucoin,ios,gettodamoneymike,1,2021-04-29 15:24:50,"Please stay away from this scam because they will steal your money and there’s nothing you can do about it when they do. I got this app so I could trade XRP since most exchanges have suspended it. I had over $12k worth of XRP and was going to trade on margin. When I was in the process of trading, the app crashed and when I opened it back up, my account had a value of $0. All of my XRP that I had been saving for over a year had evaporated in thin air and I still don’t have an answer for what happened. All I know is that I had my XRP, then their faulty app crashed and I lost everything in my account. 

There’s nothing I can do to get back what was stolen from me but hopefully, I can help others by warning them to prevent them from having everything stolen from them."

But with a little help it’s not hard to learn, but it is a hands on experience and KuCoin provides all the tools and security to become successful. KuCoin has the tools I need to learn to use and with practice I can become proficient. It is God that gives me the power to create wealth. KuCoin is a toolbox I enJOY using."

Not only do they provide a solid trading experience for more advanced traders, but the overall experience on the app is unmatched. Special promotions, futures, easy app navigation, small and micro cap tokens not supported on other exchanges, staking...and the list goes on. Most importantly, KuCoin has been more secure in recent times. Offering things like 2-Factor Authentication really adds to the security of your assets. Great exchange. Great app. Great cryptocurrency experience."
kucoin,ios,Josh_KY,1,2022-01-24 08:22:56,"I signed up and all seemed okay.   I was cruising along buying this and that.   Used the same funding account every time to load USDT.  (Speaking of USDT when I was referred as a new user, I tried to get the sign up bonus but their wording is/was purposely confusing.   I say purposely because I pointed out the grammatical errors and they just ignored me)

Anyway… yeah at first I was having to pay exorbitant fees to load USDT via 3rd party, then they finally verified me and it was 1.02 which was nice.

Then, out of the blue, I go to load $200 via same payment source as before, at same internet IP I always use, and it says “for your safety your trade has been canceled”.  I ask support and they say try a new bank card.   Grrr.   Went to my bank and got a new card.  And voila!! It still does the same thing.   And here I am 2 weeks and several closed tickets later.    

I’ve transferred most of my assets over to my Ledger for the time being.    Proceed with caution and make sure you have an exit strategy.   I was worried they would freeze my funds “for my safety”.

Best of luck!"

Only thing I can gripe about is.. that it was pretty difficult to learn how to use the app. But after messing around and learning to I became a pro. They have future trading which is definitely a plus. Tips for loading money: use an exchange you can buy crypto on like coinbase or crypto . Com and do a wallet to wallet transfer. I use algorand .. super fast transfer times. Don’t give up on the app.. you’ll figure it out.. If you can’t.. maybe you shouldn’t be trading.. lol

As an avid trader, I was excited and eager to utilize KuCoin due to their wide array of token offerings and an involved CEO. However, after a few questionable losses, I began having my suspicions about them. Low and behold, they’ve failed to address major “flaws” and are greatly profiting by liquidations. Customer service only responds with generic emails as though I’m an inexperienced trader. However, this is completely the opposite of such. I’m well aware of how this should work on an ethical platform. There’s plenty of articles finally exposing exactly how and what they are doing and can be found on Reddit in the subreddit labeled “Cryptocurrency.” 

Do NOT leave your money with these thieves."

The rest of the world seems to be a lot more free than we are. Anyways, great product! I Hope to be able to participate someday, when my overlords decide to allow it."
kucoin,ios,TheLukeShort,1,2021-10-21 02:36:46,"I’m on about 15-20 different exchanges and never seen anything freeze like Kucoin does. How on earth do they have the conscience to even charge trading fees when they make you lose your whole portfolio. Their infrastructure is out of date, and their chart freezes every hour making you think it’s one price and it’s another. Refreshing doesn’t help. This isn’t once or twice. This is every day multiple times a day. The concept of the exchange is awesome, and Kucoin could have the world with their good customer service, but until they fix the most vital issue any exchange can have, it’s dangerous to trade on here so stay away. I’ll change my review if it ever changes."
kucoin,ios,Balakay Lee,1,2020-03-31 14:56:17,"KuMex is feels years behind other exchanges, like other new exchanges, in terms of UI and API. The Stop Losses and Take Profits can’t be set on mobile when making an order. Stop Losses will randomly disappear (they claim it’s from modified a Stop Loss.. then why did the new stop loss disappear as well?).

The biggest issue with their service is the manual close on KuMex. If you attempt a market close under critical conditions if a stop loss isn’t met or “changed” the market close MAY not work in order to sever losses and avoid a liquidation. This market is dangerous and any violent movement, like on 3/13, that causes issues with the exchange can cause the UI market close to not execute. You run a very strong risk of losing serious money from this."

Today I got liquidated because KuCoin for the 3 time this week has ensured to lock us from adding more margin by making sure that crypto contracts are under maintenance as crypto crashes which further exacerbates the crash since they hold all our crypto and also lock us out from adding more margin to ensure we don’t get liquidated. I will make a tiktok and expose you and your company as you have done this several times this week alone and through the years.

When I sold, the price was back to 13 cents. All my money gone. I tried to reach out to customer support and after trying for weeks, all they could say was that crypto currencies are based on luck and I was merely dealt a bad hand.

I highly recommend you do some UX research studies with newer crypto investors to improve the product if that is your goal.

If the need for this access stems from identity validation, a more forthcoming approach where you are informed of this need early and asked to upload the needed ”proof” (whatever it is) would be much better from a privacy perspective."

After they took the 30USDT they stopped replying and when they did all they say is that they don’t know when I’ll have my coins back and to be patient . How professional right ?

You can lose money so fast, and I did. 

In my eyes they owe me money because this is there platforms fault that I’m not able to react to the market WITH MY OWN MONEY. 

I highly suggest they fix their issues, bugs and whatever else they are being lazy about and make their customers happy. At this point they have made thousands off me, but will not make a penny more until I see changes. I looked up their biggest competition and moved my money there.

Never hits your numbers always a few less or a few more then what you need. Futures kicks you out during price action or freezes causing liquidation. When you write in they can never see what happened and see send you info on how to trade futures. They don’t even check your record meaning they do v not have any sort of integrity.

⚠️WARNING ⚠️ To everyone reading this I have a simple advisory for you.

GO READ THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS ‼️

They are not exaggerating.
I didn’t read the negatives until I joined Kucoin’s platform and started experiencing problems

The negative reviews tells it all.
My story is they robbed me.
My purchases either didn’t show up in my account and my money gone.
Or my purchase did show up and was gone out of my account the next day.
I was fine while I only had 2 assets purchased but the moment I bought 3 more assets they started robbing my account as if 5 was too many for me to keep up with."

kucoin,ios,MikeTwiss,1,2020-06-21 18:49:30,"This app KuCoin is a scam. They are taking money from folks who are doing contract trading. They incorporate ways to make you have to liquidate your balance without any way to prevent it. Stop loss doesn’t work properly, and they will stop you from market orders etc. as soon as you need it most. (During volatility). 

They are also involved in a case where they are being sued for scamming users and they are not regulated by the proper financial oversight organizations. 

Don’t use this app. Apple needs to take this app down off of the App Store ASAP. This Kucoin company will disallow trust in this App Store."

I love the KuCoin application, it’s fast and the user interface is easy to learn and navigate. I like the fact that KuCoin makes it easy for me to pay for crypto with my debit card and the deposit is almost instant. However, I gave the mobile application a 3 star because it requires access to the photos stored on your phone to be able to buy crypto with fiat. This is a major turn off, there’s no reason for KuCoin to ask permissions to my photo album for me to buy crypto. I bypass this by going on their website using a PC, but it’s massively inconvenient. If they remove the need for the app to access my photo albums when trying to purchase crypto with my debit\credit card, I’ll update the rating to a 5 star.

Beat regards,

kucoin,ios,Nobody from Del Valle,3,2022-01-21 18:50:59,I began using Kucoin 2 or 3 months ago to cash in some XYO for BTC and decided to keep a few assets of various small amounts of cryptos I get from reading to earn. It took 3 of us a couple of days to figure out how to complete one transaction. Completely lost and in need of tutorials and directions. Trial and errore is scary and could get costly. Other than that it seems like a great app.

kucoin,ios,Scooty2Hooty,1,2022-04-19 18:55:02,"The one star is for their platform interface. Their UI dev team is good.

Now, lets talk about how disgusting they are with taking your money!

Deposited $1500 and right off the rip Im missing $100. 

Made $188 on a trade. They took out $167 fees. How is this legal? I set a stop limit at one price and they spread out the sales to 5 different transactions - heavily taking fees out of each one. 

I was left with $14! I REALLLYY wish i could post images because I know this is hard to believe. 

If you dont know and dont believe me when i say these people that run this platform are straight scammers...please you are welcome to find out for yourself.

Quickly took my money out after that...oh and of course that was a ridiculous $35 fee too. Never again."

kucoin,ios,Dave Wasden,5,2021-08-30 04:13:03,This app is the  best I’ve found. Took some time to learn it(still learning). It’s not that difficult once you get the hang of it.

The other exchange that I sent it too doesn’t support KuCoin network now all my hard earned money disappear into the air forever. It took nearly 2 years to save that 4K to buy that crypto just to lose it all in a blind of a second 🥲😭😢😭😭

Since it’s not “supported” in the us it won’t let me withdraw my money either..

And to top it off there is not a single number I can find to talk to someone. It’s all automated 🤬🤬"

Then realized it charges %14 for each buy!!!

All support is thru email or chat. Then I wonder if regulations or not should be better to this exchanges. Funny what make the unique is the same thing that make you wonder.

Well they like to print out these random tokens and use them as collateral to borrow against them. So fake magic money going in the market and then they move the market to their advantage to take your funds. Something tells me they are insolvent but we will see in the next couple months.

I’m sure they get away with keeping peoples money. To make a payment it redirects you to a company that no body has ever herd of and that’s shady. Why not take money directly from your platform? I have a feeling even if someone does get coins from kucoin they won’t be able to cash them out.

I find it sooooooooo dificult to use, its not user friendly, the button at the button are hard to understand what they mean and i havent figured out how to transfer from main to trading wallet. And vice versa. I need to use website exchange to do all my trading…."
kucoin,ios,JordanDunn03,5,2021-08-17 05:43:37,I was able to buy and transfer to Coinbase. Not sure about the customer service but the app seems to be secure and I had no issues.
kucoin,ios,TVRtyler,1,2021-11-07 18:22:42,"I wouldn't go so far as to call KuCoin a ""scam"" but it's pretty close. The withdraw fees that they charge are almost theft. $35 fee to withdraw any amount of USDT. 800,000 SHIB fee to withdraw any amount of SHIB. 0.005 BTC fee to withdraw any amount of BTC. And it goes on and on.  It is pretty ridiculous. 

Then there is the fact that I've lost over $300 in withdraws that never arrived in the wallets they were sent too, even though the addresses were LITERALLY copy and pasted. 

The fees are %100 my fault because I obviously did not read the fine print well enough. The disappearance of money in withdraws gets nowhere with KuCoin support, as you'd expect. 

Do your due diligence if you're going to use this app."
kucoin,ios,Imdamnmadmaddamn,5,2021-05-26 08:10:36,"The best app in the game. Live, smart and genuinely interested in helping customer service team. It still takes Coinbase a month to get back to people. Just all around great app and experience. Currently Kucoin is crypto!"

When I come to open kucoin it shows on top “kucoin pasted from (app name that I used to copy in buffer)” I did not want to paste anything in Kucoin. There was not even a text box where I put cursor and hard press to see a paste option. I think kucoin is secretly collecting the buffer data."

kucoin,ios,HbyTV,1,2021-08-19 11:55:12,"The app is good except that there's basically no charting functions whatsoever. All you can do is look at candlesticks, but you can't draw trendlines like most other exchange apps. If these functions are added then the app would be a solid 5 stars! Update: still no trendlines and I’ve also noticed they don’t have trailing stop losses either. Downgrade to 1 star. If they add trendlines and stop losses it’s a 5 star app."
kucoin,ios,skelleyp,1,2021-11-27 03:03:30,By far one of the worst apps I’ve ever used. I can’t even began to explain how poor this app runs. Don’t get it. If you want to go through three step login verification and forceing you to change your password every time you login. Telling you you no longer have an account under that email or number just to let you in two or three days later. STAY AWAY!

I had an issue where all of a sudden my trading passcode didn’t work while I was in some futures contracts. Changed the passcode 3 times trying to get it to work with no success.

All my positions were liquidated as I sat there watching unable to close a trade. KuCoin customer service blamed me and didn’t remedy the situation.

Don’t just take my word for it though - a quick google search will show you all types of ways they steal their customers money.

I only write reviews when it’s something the public should know , good or bad.

I got lured to this trading platform with the intent to earn 15percent of my investment in each trade I thought it was a good trading platform not knowing they were sneaky and manipulating to take away all my funds. After weeks of being sad I found the best cryptocurrency recovery pundit phantomHackerX0X (at) gmail. Com Whom I hired and spoke with their support team about my situation. They requested for some certain information and they swing into actions immediately. To my surprise within hours they were able to trace and track my stolen funds then subsequently they recover each and every penny of my money back to me without hassle or hidden charges. This is the best recovery specialist to hire to recover all your stuck, missing or scammed funds and digital assets. They are the real deal send a detailed email to this team at phantomHackerX0X (at) gmail.

crypto.com,ios,Bobby de Ortega,5,2022-11-12 23:25:11,"Out of all the Crypto exchanges out there, this is the one that clearly stands out due to their professionalism and consistent high-quality experiences to include this app. Over the last few years I have done business with several Centralized Exchanges and this one happens to be my favorite due to their privacy practices, stable experiences and tight customer service. If ever I had a question related to my investments they were quick to answer. Not only that, they have taken proactive steps to ensuring secure practices. With all of that said I would also highly-recommend that anyone reading this review to also consider a “cold storage” solution if they want even more control and security over their investments. Also, seriously do your homework in this space as there is a lot to learn and—at times—peril. Inform yourself, take calculated risks (or don’t) and mitigate any unnecessary risk or lack of security that you can. This space is both promising and relatively new and will not go away by virtue of the follies of some of the less mature characters out there. 

Excellent app, thank you."
crypto.com,ios,crypto jj,1,2022-02-18 13:39:08,"This app started great, it has many good features like the airtime pay for cellphone service that you can use with the Crypto that your holding. The downfall happened to me recently after securing the account with 2fa. In the beginning of the account security it was great, transfer went smooth, but then there was a attack on CRYPTO last month that caused some disturbances resulting in a 2fa reset forcing certain users to apply this change. Since this was done for me already it didn’t bother me until I went to transfer funds to discover the 2fa was not accurate. This is where the problem started. I contacted customer service and the bot spat out a inaccurate solution resulting in me texting a random agent that request that I submit a video for “security” reasons. After providing said video, it was not good enough, so I have to change email address to “secure” the account. I thought it was over until I get another email saying “he he hee” we need another video of glycine hiding a ransom sign. Now the crypto card I have is frozen and this is still a ongoing issue.

Update: In order to Get back into the account I had to literally submit 8 MORE VIDEOS!!! Keep in mind that it’s in a UNSECURE EMAIL, which means your identity will be compromised by another party to be used without your knowledge. This is a Major concern of mine and with the current trend I’m not sure if I will be victimized by this FORCED “security” policy.

Again beware….."
crypto.com,ios,Tommyloansu,1,2021-06-09 22:15:50,"I’m an Admin in a trading group and we all share different ideas and alert each other of apps that steal your money.  This APP is horrible!!!!  On this app I had most of my money in ALGO (Algorand).  It took a nice 20% increase and I went to go take the profits and move them to CRO.  MAGICALLY my ability to trade was stopped!  I contacted them, took screen shots,  let them know what was going on and that I was losing my profits by the second….  They responded saying it would be fixed later.  Not “let us trade it where you need it or anything of the sort”. They waited until it dropped all the way down to what I bought it at!  Then had the audacity to say, and I quote ”. Thanks for the reply. I totally understand, however, the issue was resolved and you were able to withdraw the funds.
If you have additional questions do not hesitate to get back to us.”   They basically said screw you the same way Robin Hood app does. Scams.   COINBASE and COINBASE PRO is the way to go.  DO NOT GET SCAMMED WHEN YOU SHOULD BE MAKING MONEY!  Again, do not use this app.  Buy rates are always off compared to the actual market and always in their favor.  They say on these reviews “contact us and we’ll look into it” but they just blow you off once they scam you.  You buy for more than the market and sell for less and they don’t let you sell if your currency you’ve put money in pumps.  I wish I could put negative stars instead of one."
crypto.com,ios,Sxmjdushsb,2,2025-01-21 12:16:39,"It’s astonishing how horrible the user interface is. My first thoughts along with others before me is the app is intentionally confusing. They don’t offer candle charts. Only a line chart. It’s fine if they dont offer any indicators at all but they literally don’t offer moving averages..they need a horizontal line on the chart to compare current price to past price. You cannot look at past price & current price at the same time since they take up the same space which makes me constantly think the current price is different than what it actually is. The worst thing to me besides no moving averages is (to my disbelief) THE CONSTANT POP UP ADS! This app is 90% ADS!! even when I disable them I’m still getting pop up ads telling me to bet my money on sports & etc.. WTH. Also I hate brokerage apps that are filled with more words than numbers. I literally hate this app & it gives me headaches & a given up heart knowing this is the app imma stick to because of their low fees. The web app is broken & doesn’t show price averages. The only good thing is their customer support section ironically enough. You can close it & open it up & continue conversations on your own time whenever you’d like which is awesome. If you just add a horizontal line, simple moving averages & stop the pop up ads I would have way less complaints about this app."
crypto.com,ios,Justin Bayc,1,2023-11-10 15:36:04,"I’ve had an account with these guys for over two years. I pulled a good amount of money out at the end of the last bull run, but left a few hundred bucks in to play with some smaller coins. I would check in like once every 6 months just to see where things are at and all’s been good. Price action was slow so I didn’t feel the need to make an trades. Now things have awakened in the market so I got excited and I went to sign in. Verified my identity like normal. Get to the Home Screen and bam. $0.00 across the board on all assets…… completely gone. Thankfully I only had a few hundred bucks in there but imagine if I hadn’t pulled out my thousands of dollars from before. It would JUST. BE. GONE. I’ve reached out to customer service but it is very automated and getting any meaningful responses to what I would consider is a severe problem has been met with no answers, concern, or general interest to them. Why are all my assets wiped off completely? Even if the markets fell off there would be a few Pennies in there. Transaction history wiped. I have emails proving buys of certain assets and confirmations. But for some reason that evidence doesn’t concern this company AT ALL. I cannot and will not ever recommend this platform. I don’t want to seem like a shill for other platforms but I think your money is safer in literally any other platform or exchange. Can’t believe it. Zero stars."
crypto.com,ios,Fosejo,2,2022-01-27 12:46:59,"At the beginning, I was happy with this app it is a nice app in the sense that you can earn additional income from owning the different crypto assets. The only issue and the biggest issue that I have is that when I try to make purchases with my debit card, it’s a hit and miss and more often than not It is a miss. When I try to make a purchase some of the times it will go through most of the times it doesn’t go through and the issue is not my bank it is the application. I tried to go through their customer service, but their best advice was to transfer money to the application. What if I don’t want to transfer money, I want to use my debit card so I can purchased the crypto as I go along. Also,If you have a customer that is telling you there’s an issue with a certain part of the application why not try to resolve the issue instead of telling them to not use that part of the application and do their purchases a different way. Overall, yes I do like the application, but I get frustrated very often with it because of the fact that I cannot make my purchases that easily. When I started using the application, all my purchases were going through nice and easy but now I do not know what it is that they did and it is just not that easy. Hope you improve this app and make it work the proper way."
crypto.com,ios,$cashguy$,4,2021-08-25 19:03:14,"So far I am very new to this app, however from what I’ve experienced, most of the negative reviews are from beginners that did not take the time to read and understand what they were getting themselves into. I currently have the jade green card and I can say that I have already received my Netflix rebate so that works. I have not tried to withdraw my funds yet as I’m waiting on my money to transfer so I can test everything, however I have spend money with the virtual card and got my money back in cro that way as well. So far it has done everything it should. Also, I have experienced one problem with my card info not displaying on one of my devices however the customer support has been great and they are working on it. If you find yourself with that problem, I would recommend trying a different device if possible. In the end customer support has been kind and respectful and if you take the time to understand the fees that this app should help you earn some serious cash. In the end, just do test payments and be 100% sure of what should happen and be patient. I just hope that they get a website working and one point, other than that I am happy with what I have :)"
crypto.com,ios,Agugz,1,2022-06-14 14:21:16,"UPDATE: I have been in contact with the Crypto support team. It is the absolute worst! Now, every time I send an email asking them the status of my money, this is the response I get:”We are awaiting an update from our dedicated team.  As soon as we have an update, we will let you know.”  BTW, this has been going for over one week!!  When I used to transfer money from my account to Crypto, it took a couple of seconds. There were no issues at all. Now getting my money from Crypto has become the biggest headache!  I REGRET downloading this app!

I have been trying to withdraw my money from Crypto into my bank account. They use Plaid to connect to your financial institution. For some reason, Plaid throws an error message stating ‘Something went wrong. Please try again later’. This has been going on for a few days. Crypto support says the issue is with Plaid, and they can’t give me Plaid support contacts. When I got with Plaid, they say to contact Crypto. I have done all the troubleshooting steps Crypto told me to do, and still doesn’t work. But surprisingly, there’s absolutely no issues using Plaid to withdraw money from my bank account and sending it to Crypto. No error messages there. But trying to get my money from Crypto to my bank account somehow, miraculously doesn’t work. Crypto is basically now telling me there’s nothing they can do about it!!!"
crypto.com,ios,#j-wat,4,2021-09-09 15:57:47,"I really like using this app to trade cryptos because it is fast and has great coverage of many coins out there. I think it is shady that there’s a magic “premium” added to coins when BTC is rising, and this is a money grab in my opinion because that premium is not applied when you sell. For example, CRO was .1210 when I tried to buy, and after doing the math (which is not provided because they know it’s shady) my average cost was somewhere around .125. Not a huge difference but that is hard earned profit by this point. I have been trying to get my CRO card for weeks now and I have been told that the only way I can continue with my application is to provide a picture of my SSN card. This was due to me moving addresses multiple times in the past few years because I am a college student. It is very frustrating and the support, albeit responds in a timely manner, does not seem like they really want to get you to your end goal. With all that said, I still trade here and love checking in on my cryptos. Unfortunately, after my staking period WHICH IS DUMB BECAUSE I DID NOT EVEN RECEIVE A CARD is over I will be transferring my balance to coin base or some other more reliable system."

It is easy on and off for through ACH with Chase bank, had trouble with 2 other smaller banks limited to 1k and 5k transfers, chase allows 25k, once I did a withdrawal and had no issue. They just now opened up US to use a separate program to exchange tokens ( coins), so should be less expensive fees in trading and remember you will pay transfer fees to other crypto wallets ( called gas fees), but the coins moved dictate the amount, due your research before trading to check tax consequences for each and every transaction, can be a nightmare! I gave app 4 stars, over all better that Coinbase as far as I’m concerned. Look at there debit card choices, nice options and rewards. Other features are nice like staking stable coins, however they just announced a reduction in interest in staking those. Overall great company, growing leaps and bounds"

I've heard my whole life ""pay yourself first"" but that amounted to impulse buys for more junk I simply don't need, burying me in useless detritus I can never find when I need it 'cause it's buried under other just as useless rubble!  Buying crypto gives me that endorphin hit I desire without increasing the amount of stuff soffocating my very existence.  It's also hitting that betting urge and at much better odds then any casino.  Advice,  buy for the long term, only spend free money that you would've wasted on something mundane.  I started by buying 20,000 shares of VET @.02 cents ea. It's now at about,07, buts been as high as .11, I have no doubt that future readers of this review will look back on these figures and wish they bought in while it was so undervalued.  In closing:  I'm not a financial advisor and money runs through my fingers like water through a net, this app after so many failed attempts to save money has finally allowed us a savings.  It's a great feeling."
crypto.com,ios,Drodum,5,2024-03-02 00:28:44,"I have been using this application for all of my crypto buy/sell/sending needs. Once you understand the “flow” of the app, like how to send crypto, it made sense and builds a lot of trust in the user. It is near impossible to send crypto to a wrong wallet, it simplifies the “bridge” to the off exchange wallet functions, it make it easy to add and subtract fiat from bank to bank. It does a lot of different thing well. And with less restriction like daily limits and what not. A lot better than some of the other apps like coinbase and the like. Yes there is a learning curve so on a scale of 1-5, one being cash app simple of just see bitcoin buy bitcoin, to 5 being the full exchange with stop losses, shorts, leverage trading etc, this is a 3. Almost like a gateway into the more complex trading dex’es. I love and enjoy all of the extra added functions and information like the average cost of investment and so on. 

Great app. They have invested a lot into make it more informative, user friendly and a safe place to make crypto investments."

So I can’t fund my account or get a response to what is the issue, they will keep saying contact support and would love to take a closer look at your problem but I know even then I probably won’t get a response or a resolution and at this point I am just waiting for my term in crypto earn to pass so I can transfer all my crypto to another app.

Updated, they said “rest assured support will contact you “ yes they did contact me, they told me they are having 0 issues on their side and that I need to try alternative options to deposit funds on my account. Guess what? The alternative options require fees and are not instant except for Apple Pay to instantly buy crypto with fees. I also noticed the price differences on there vs other apps, they do have significant differences in their favor, so those are like more hidden fees. Just you are better off using any other app."

CDC has been very very shady the past few months. They change huge polices over night, multiple times a month, and without notice. At least recently. You can’t trust them. Don’t fall into the trap too of getting one of their cards because they can slash those rates overnight (as they did) and then “upgrade it” slightly to make it seem like they’re doing you a favor lol look up some of their Reddit forums and you’ll see how much of the community, especially a lot of their older loyal investors, have been screwed over lately. You can’t trust these guys because they don’t communicate ANY changes they’re going to make. Or if they do by chance, they’ll enact it days before the announced date just to throw everyone for a loop and screw them up that way. The only people who will try to convince you that CDC is still good are the people who invested more than they can afford to lose in CRO (their crypto). They’re afraid if CDC goes down, CRO will go down and they’ll lose money. My advice is to use coinbase instead. Never had any problems with them. CDC also recently reversed transactions when people were trading and making profits!! Look it up and be careful with this app/company."

However, my account got hacked and they emailed me, stating there were abnormalities and unusual activity in my account. They locked my account and made me jump through hoops to get it unlocked, (sending at least 10 different selfies, stating pics were too far, too close etc. and some other steps.) when I regained access the majority of my tokens/coins were gone. I made them aware of the missing coins/tokens and they said they would investigate it. Again, they made me jump through hoops to start the investigative process. (Again with the selfies and other steps etc.) After a few days they sent me an email and said, there are no abnormalities with your account, we concluded you are responsible for the missing coins/tokens. Very strange since they informed me there was unusual activity with my account and locked it. I wasn’t even aware of it. I guess they didn’t want to replace the tokens/coins or admit they were hacked, who knows. I filed complaints with the SEC and FTC. So be careful with this App. Not a very good experience for me."

I was able to deposit money on my Crypto account from my debit card pretty smoothly. Taking money out is pretty straight forward as long as your bank is on the list of compatible banks (which are big name banks and credit unions) I have a very small credit union so I had to open a bank account that was on that list. Pretty common with most app involving bank linking. The only thing I would like to be improved is faster customer service. They will always help you and resolve your issues but you just got to have patience. I understand because of the increased interest in Crypto which increases customers which inevitably increases issues. That being said...customer service response time: ⭐️⭐️⭐️. customer service helpfulness/problem resolution ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️. Platform and navigation through app ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️. Information and transparency ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️. Anyway I love this app so far and I think you should give it a chance. I will leave an updated review 60 days from now."

Specifically, the average cost basis should provide users with an ongoing calculation that considers adjustments for purchases, sales, transfers, and crypto earnings, allowing them to see their average investment per share over time. The total cost basis would encompass all investment transactions, including fees, giving users a comprehensive view of their financial outlay.

Furthermore, the overall yearly, five/ten year, and total years performance metrics should reflect the percentage change in value since the initial investment, factoring in both realized and unrealized gains or losses. For example, for annual performance, we could provide a year-over-year analysis highlighting their investments' performance relative to benchmarks, helping users identify trends and make informed decisions. These functionalities would significantly enhance user engagement by delivering valuable insights into their investment metrics and improving their overall experience with the app."

There is no reason I should still be waiting for approval if my friends were approved that fast!

So now I have yet another friend who downloaded the app and was approved in 15 minutes!!! You guys need to get organized because this is just terrible!!! Not to mention the fact I have now contacted y’all through the app 3 times and have emailed y’all numerous times now! No response! No help! No anything! Email me back and verify my account please!

Now After a few days I finally got a response to my email. You know what it said!? To reply to their response if I needed help and they would email me back within 24 hours as a priority. They never emailed me back when I replied!? What kind of customer service is this?????? Is this what you guys do?

crypto.com,ios,Cam748282,1,2024-12-02 18:59:51,"This app has a massive spread on it. They don’t say there is hidden fees and deny it when pressed about it. They overcompensate the spreads so they gain money on your trade when you buy and sell.

For example: you buy a crypto for $1 on their app and you want to sell that crypto immediately. Now you can only sell that crypto for $0.90 but the chart and prices are still the same. They are scamming you. Pick a better app that has a lower spread ( i think Binance is much lower). In this same situation on another app you may buy something for $1.00 and will be able to sell it immediately for about $.97.

This app also doesn’t have bar charts, live data, and you can only see the buy + sell spread after purchase. Their unrealized gains are inaccurate and lead you to believe you are up more than you actually are (they don’t base it off the sell price). For example I had an unrealized gain of $40 on the chill guy stock (i only bought it for $50) and almost doubled my money on it. I went to sell (and didn’t realize the large spread) and after i confirmed my sell order I actually only had profited $11. So i stead of $90 i was lead to believe I only came away with $61. I hope somebody with money sets up a clash action against these scammers."

Enjoyed using the app and learned a lot. I have found the charts misleading and it seems  the fees built in to each transaction are unpredictable % and often much higher or lower than the chart prices. Additionally by listing so many inaccessible tokens and coins, it makes scrolling for research exhaustive.  
I have submitted suggestions to ‘enhance user experience ’ such as more detailed user portfolio including cost, cost average, profits or loss etc. at one point it seemed they were listening by replying that my ideas were ‘forwarded ‘.  So with each update comes ‘enhancements for user experience’ but each update focused more on NFT sales etc with no change for users view of their own holdings. 
4 of 5 stars Hoping someday they add the aforementioned features and have transparent retail cost and more accurate charts."

But that does no good because their price reporting is inaccurate. I figured it was a bug and reached out to support. They did nothing but copy and paste responses, and when I tried to get them to elaborate on what I’m asking I was told to “consider the subject exhausted.” Meaning they had no interest in telling me what I was trying to find out. They will show and record incorrect or higher than market prices, and those prices are shown when buying, but if you already own a coin, and go to sell at that same time, the selling price is magically way lower than any other price they’re showing. They’re graphs only load when they want, I couldn’t even try to tell you the refresh rate. I found out all of that AFTER trying to figure out how to move my money around in they’re system. You can buy with a card no problem for a fee, but when you go to sell or withdraw your funds you must make a separate wallet account, attach your bank account to it, and then start a withdrawal that takes a day. The entire App is made to take and keep your money. I applaud those who think positively of the app. I wish I could too."

When I wanted to withdraw it all back to my bank because it was way too complicated for me; I was told that my funds were frozen through a third party regulator.  I have spent over a week chatting with customer service.  I was originally told that I needed to pay BCT to get my account unfrozen.  I learned that this was a scam.  I have repeatedly chatted with “who is supposed to be customer service.”. I am being told I have to pay a deposit or bond of $104,000 to have my account unfrozen.  I have been told that if I don’t pay this amount after 5 days they will charge a 1% fee until my entire wallet is drained and they will be donating to charity.  I keep seeing there are scammers and I don’t need to pay to have my account unfrozen, but it is the same response from customer service.  
I have asked for a phone number, a manager, for it to be escalated and I receive nothing in return.  I do not want to pay a deposit or bond to receive my funds but I can’t seem to find any other options.

crypto.com,ios,WilliamI7,1,2021-05-19 03:13:17,"First off im in the US, which means this app offers a lot that many here don't.
The issue is that the app is almost unusable. If anyone says this app is easy, they were lucky or lying. Banks consider it a scam, so just getting past that is a pain, but even if you do the app has an extreme chance of just glitching. Then if you do manage to begin trading there can be serious delays of over a week making it difficult to make time sensitive decisions. Lastly is what i consider to be mild scamming regarding transfers. Transferring into the app was very easy... Transferring out after being disappointed was obviously set up to be difficult. Setting up transfers is extremely glitchy and made me have to write down addresses manually because the app would glitch every time i went to copy one. Also with minimum limits far higher than the ones set for transferring in, i literally couldn't take out what i put in. Lastly the app is just simply slower and clunkier than any other crypto app ive found. 
I would consider this a work in progress except they have spent so much time and resources over the past year on marketing instead of development, so my hopes were completely gone."

I January of 2022 “cyberscammers” tricked me into depositing $420 (that I could not afford) to this application. As soon as it occurred to me that what had taken place was a scam, I emailed the app security and it was immediately locked down. I was so relieved in that moment. And then my nightmare began. I had to do video proof sessions that took place for hours at a time because they kept switching agents in the middle of the process on more than 3 different occasions because they have continuously locked me out of my account for no reason. Now I have changed my phone number several times as well (the same one each time) and I still need to change the number again which is beyond annoying because it takes hours and they never follow-through. So while I can vouch for the fact that it is a fun and exciting way to do crypto if you can sign in,  I cannot gaurantee you will always have that option. They have the worst customer service ever.

Small time funds will always be locked unlike many other exchanges with much lower, usually 0.001, or with Gemini, 0. If you’re using this to invest small time money of DCA I highly recommend turning away. This app has a $20 withdraw fee at .0004btc to move it to any more secure wallets. Their 2fa bugged out and I had to reset it. I had to spend over 4 days sending and buying funds to get enough btc to finally withdraw just to discover there’s a $20 withdraw fee. Every other exchange I can think of has fees so small they’re still under $10 when moving thousands. Half of this bad experience is due to my negligence of not researching withdraw mins and fees. So it goes to show to do your research. Either way it would not have ch aged my opinion, My mistake doesn’t negate that this app still has high withdrawal mins, high fees, and high withdraw fees.

This app is a joke, if you take any thing away from this, I used this for years transferred everything to Robinhood and Coinbase and will never come back. The other apps trade at market value with no commission, and only charge $5 month. That’s way better than paying a 5% premium on each coin/ stock.

This all started on the 16 of February it’s been over a month and still no help and no change. Please listen to negative review of at least this one and use any other app."
crypto.com,ios,Tragor57,1,2021-08-24 15:42:22,"Thus company made an app that can lock you out of your wallet when they want to.
This means they can block users from buying or selling at a time you can make or protect from loosing money.  
No app like that should have been allowed on Apple store.  This is criminal fraud!  Intent to commit fraud is a crime and using it to do so a crime.
Who is responsible to bring justice?  Yeah no one! So whatever money you put in here be prepared to login and see it disappear but not actually transact as a built in option they control.
The bug users reported they say was fixed. Well they now allow access and show totals that are accurate but individually block use for transactions. That’s fraud at its best.  If you now closed my account then give me my wallet I’d?  You had no problem taking my money.  It takes weeks of them telling me it’s my phone now they say senior management close my account?  Hello - Um where my money?  How many weeks till I can transfer my assets or cash out?  What a joke!  I knew using app where they control the wallet was disaster glad I didn’t go in enough to get massively screwed but what about the guys who did!!!"
crypto.com,ios,Smartkarthi,3,2021-05-29 02:25:47,"App looks great. I wanted to invest in CRO just bcos of how app is designed that gives confidence on it. But there is so much pain buying it. Eventually I staked CRO. First none of Credit cards in US works atleast what I hold. And then so much delay in transferring money to Fiat balance (4 or 5 days) by the time you end up investing thro other exchanges.  Even if u transfer most of time it’s slow and especially when big market movements and u wanted to use ur debit card to make faster purchase. Now it’s not even showing debit card option.

I wanted to highlight the notifications issue that's annoying so much. For the cryptos you track when you receive notifications abt price changes it's totally incorrect for the time. Price u see in notification and what you see after you tap to open are totally different. Not just by a fraction but by so many percentages. For example I see notification for  $1.82 up by 10% but upon opening it shows $1.55 down %. I end up disabling the notifications for now"
crypto.com,ios,nickbhs5000name,1,2025-03-04 06:36:45,"I used my crypto card to pay for my hotel deposit but was never refunded my deposit. After calling the hotel I was able to see that there was no hold on the deposit and was advices to speak with crypto. Let me tell you this process was exhausting and untimely. The first representative stated that the money was returned, but I was able to submit a photo of the transaction still saying pending in my account. A day later, when I was finally able to text someone higher, they stated they needed proof and the money was returned again. After submitting proof that I had no extra charges from the hotel and left with a $0 balance, and the charge still shows as pending in my account my issue was still not resolved. I was told funds could return after 30-60 days but it’s up to the hotel to release the funds. This was frustrating to me considering the fact that I had already submitted evidence of the hotel not holding any funds. The help desk service for this card is ridiculous and most importantly the money that I worked for is apparently gone without a resolution. To be honest this entire deal seems like a scam."
crypto.com,ios,theOtherWB,4,2021-09-03 02:49:48,I’m only giving four stars because you really need to do your homework to learn about prices. The coins themselves have different sale % that come off the top. Crypto itself has no fees for buying/a unless you’re using your debit/ccard. However you need to learn the sale percentages of the coins. The price reflected on the graph daily is not the actual price. That’s the buy price. What I do is use the Binance app for the real price so that I’m not ticked off when I sell and find it’s $20 to sell when actually they’re reasonable. Setting up a bank account requires specific banks. Make sure yours is on the list. Once you get the hang of the fiat wallet and your buy/sale percentages it really is a great up. Set all your financial stuff up and get your bank account squared away before you buy anything. Get secure with how to get your money back into your pocket. Easy to use. Highly recommended.

Such as: I want to send a few dollars of bitcoin directly from the in-app wallet to another wallet. It glitches on my phone and shows me a blank screen. I have to use a friends phone. Multi factor authorization every time I log in. Turns out there’s a minimum to send bitcoin. Have to login to my phone again to buy more bitcoin. Log in to friends phone again. That’s four times I’ve had to use multi factor authorization now. Send Bitcoin. Oh there’s a fee and it’s 50% of the total amount sent? Fine. Oh and now I find out it will take 2-3 hours to process?

Absolutely miserable experience. I’m sure this app is great if you’re bored and have nothing else to do. If you’re busy and have a regular job and life, it’s a soul-sucking experience.

First you send a message to a robot then it say’s sorry we can’t help you we will send you to a live person. The person I got was pretty quick getting back but couldn’t fix my request so she had to send me to someone else. This was a joke. They sent me the same info the last person tried even though I had screenshots then I waited and waited for this last person to even see my message. I stared at my phone for 30 mins until I got tired of waiting. A hour or so later they sent me a message finally and all it said was looks like you are unavailable if you need anything else please feel free to send a message. Like what?? You only waited 21 mins before you said later. I waited a hour. All together it was a total of 3 hours to end up getting no help. I’m so angry right now. Glad it wasn’t an emergency!!!

After NUMEROUS “messaging conversations,” I’ve been left feeling completely helpless after receiving computer generated responses and not once being offered addl help in resolving the issue - or the $25 I was promised for signing up. 
After trying multiple different types of payment methods from debit to credit cards and being unsuccessful at every turn, I don’t have so much as a customer service number to call and speak to anyone about this. I’ve spoken to my banks multiple times and after asking several times for a customer service number during these message conversations, I have yet to receive a number or response regarding my question. It’s been a 3-day process and I have yet to be able to invest a single dollar because of this flawed system. 
If you’re looking to invest in the “near-future” and don’t mind being left helplessly in the dark, this may be the place for you, if not, and you’re looking to hop the train sooner than later, I'd look elsewhere."

However, once I enter my email and followed the instructions that require you to open the hyperlink from your email and relaunch the app. The app never opens. I have had a chat open for over 48hrs with tech support and have not had one response yet. Therefore, I have no access to my crypto for the past 4 days. I tried all the options and even followed step by step instructions on the FAQ page. Nothing has worked. Deleted the app, reinstalled it, emptied my cache in my browser and deleted all emails like it says to do. Still no access to my account. Be very careful where you keep your crypto.

Unfortunately many features on the app just did not work for me.. was unable to purchase with a Credit Card (tried several times with two cards.. I even tried on different days. I just got a blank empty screen.. I called my bank, but they had no record of the attempts) the app will frequently freeze up and I had to attempt my first few purchases multiple times because the price would update.. this is fine, except it would kick me all the way back to the Home Screen and make me start over. I’m on an iPhone 12 Pro less than a year old..

Reached out to customer service in their “chat” feature, but they didn’t respond until several hours later at like 2am and all they said is that it could take a couple days, and then a few minutes after that they closed the chat because I was unresponsive. Then, it turns out they “can’t verify” me... not sure why. No option to check pictures or answer questions or anything, so I reached out to customer service again. Same thing, no response until several hours later in the middle of the night, only to tell me THEY DONT HAVE TO TELL why they reject people, and then closed the chat because I wasn’t responsive.  Super disrespectful to treat people like that who have trusted them with their sensitive info. At least have the courtesy to explain what’s going on or give an opportunity to work through whatever the mystery issue is. All my accounts are in good standing.

They said they cannot help me unless I were to put more money in, wait for it to transfer and then withdraw it out once I reach the threshold. I do not need to be working on my masters in cyber security to comprehend how a legitimate business would ever tell a customer to just give them deposit money to receive money back. Please be extremely careful and do your research before making investments when using shady and up and coming applications. I am writing a report for my class about fraudulent online storefronts and I am referencing this app in particular. The customer service was very vague when asking particular questions about security concerns. I am hesitant to call it a scam outright but I do not feel comfortable depositing more money into the app to revive my current balance. That should speak volumes to new customers.

crypto.com,ios,jillcicle,2,2025-01-21 14:16:02,"I’m looking for a crypto trade platform, not progressively more pointed promo of a certain political figure’s meme coins in things like a “Freedom Basket” getting advertised to me. App has been occasionally glitchy over the past few years, including quite recently, and kept me from selling when time was of the essence. (Often this is because an update is available, but it won’t tell you this, it just glitches on sales!) Was wary but could have handled that if they weren’t getting overtly propagandistic. 

We all know you made a deal with the devil by pouring insane amounts of influence money into the election but leave your customers out of it. Final straw after more and more annoying push notifications trying to encourage market volatility and forcibly shoving customers into the incredibly high risk Strike Options screen.

The UI is extremely difficult to understand since they use odd terminology that would normally mean other things like “transfer” might mean to another wallet and not from one coin to another or you might need to select the word “sell” when you just want to convert one coin to another.  It gets really confusing and is not user friendly at all.  Support is very, very poor.  I ordered the debit card and got an email saying it had been sent but it didn’t come.  After a couple weeks I wrote to support but they never answered.  I finally got the card two weeks later and activated it.  I tried to top it off with the balance the app said I had but my balance was in their coin and it doesn’t have an option to use that for the card.  I tried to sell their coin but it said it was locked.  It turns out, the balance was from their “gift” which can’t be unlocked unless I buy more coins and stake them.  It was complete deceit.

They have no morals and should you choose to ignore my warning, be prepared to never see any $ they control ever again. This is the single most dishonest company ive ever encountered and urge you NOT to download this app. Hope this app gets pulled from the App Store bc its basically designed to never let users access actual money. They have designed a process that will never allow users to access funds once they’ve been deposited. So, even if you make tons of money off crypto...they’ll never let you actually get your hands on it! You wouldn’t believe the excuses I’ve been given.

But low and behold, I cannot actually complete the transfer because the app freezes as soon as I click “confirm” to transfer my money out. Then I contact customer service again and they are asking for more ridiculous things. I don’t understand how I have to keep contacting customer service to trade my stocks and transfer my money. 

This app is a scam! Do not use it to trade crypto. All they do is take your money hostage and make you jump through hoops for the most basic features. Now I want to close my account and it’s one headache after another."

Disrespectful the entire time  not helpful at all.

This is my first time buying crypto or any investments really, and dipping my toes in the pool of crypto currency through this app has been phenomenal! Although nothing is without its faults, I do have a bit of a problem with the notification system. I have multiple types of notifications set to go off if some cryptos hit different price point but they never go off. Even with notifications on in-app and in the settings on my phone.
I’ve missed out on some big opportunities because of this. I don’t want to have to move to another app to fix this issue so it’d be awesome if you couple help resolve it.

 P.S. It’d be awesome if you were to tweak the little colorful screen and sound it does when you successfully buy or trade by adding a little vibration. That would be a really nice touch, kinda like a cherry on top this already really cool app!"

Initial Review - Okay I’ll chalk 2% of my issues as a beginner app user to user error. However the lack of information in the user guide to resolve issues is disappointing They say how to but never if you get “this error” here’s how to resolve…. Also I could use the support chat with was instant until I needed a tech specialist now over gone 48 hours without and answer other than “thanks for your comment and if you have any more questions were just a message away”. Seems silly when the original questions have yet to be answered or resolved. Plus I no longer have the instant chat access via the app it’s just the specialist unhelpful resource."
crypto.com,ios,Kelly.in.gilroy,3,2021-04-20 22:51:27,"Absolutely absurd withdrawals fees! Why does this app charge so much to move your coins? And it’s not just a little higher, it’s outrageously higher. Nothing to do with network fees either. 
Also when buying or selling you have to buy a minimum and when selling there is a minimum which then if you don’t have enough to sell what are you suppose to do? 
You also have to have a minimum to move off the exchange so the only option ends up buying more coins to sell or move! Such a scam. 
And lastly, when buying I notice the prices are higher than other exchanges and lower when selling! This company is ripping all of us off. Very annoyed and bought when I was newer into crypto and didn’t know better. Now I will definitely lose huge profits due to their company policies. 
Do not use until they change their fees! It’s definitely not easy to know this up front! Hope this helps others."

I tried two more times and still didn’t work. Two days later, I saw 3 withdrawals on my checking. So the payments went through without telling me they did, and was super slow because the bitcoin went up afterward and thus forced me to buy it at a higher price than what I originally was paying for. 
So I try to withdraw my money out of the Bitcoin ownership and there is no clear way of doing that! All they allowed me to do was to transfer it to another coin or purse. I just wanted my money back!!! So I had to search google for 30 minutes to learn a complex way of pulling my cash back out.

I just spent FOUR YEARS fighting a $20,000 tax bill for a year when I only made $1,000 through investments - do those numbers add up? NOPE. Third - Strike Options are clearly rigged. There is a demo simulator for you to play around with and test strategies. Sounds neat, problem is the simulator will let you win most trades at a higher rate than the real system. So in the simulator you’ll make bank but then when you apply the exact same strategy to live trading it just takes all your money. This is clearly designed to manipulate investors by instilling false-confidence. These people are scammers, liars, cheaters, and thieves all the way through.

While there aren’t a lot of fees, the price differential on buys/sells bites (if ur not trading much, not a big deal, as long as ur in a winning trade). However, I’ve lost out on many thousands $ because they cap u at $10k a day buy/$25k a month buy (for the 25,000 CRO tier). Highly frustrating, it has changed my entire plan for investing. It’s nice getting 3% CRO on purchases, but as of last week the CRO price dropped to about half of 5-6 weeks ago. Last thoughts, they have made every decision (the kind that hit ur financial enterprise) with zero notice, literally with zero second notice. And, there have been a few back to back. So, if you want to earn 3% (CRO) on purchases, and don’t trade more than $25K in trades a month; it’s not bad, even okay."

crypto.com,ios,Jones G-Money,1,2020-12-30 11:11:57,"The spread is ridiculously wide; you’d end up losing 6 to 12 times the amount you would have paid for an average commission with other brokers per trade.  It doesn’t have Exchange, so you’re pretty much playing roulettes and hope your gains don’t end up getting spent on the spread when trading.  If the value of your coins drop in the middle of the night or when you’re away from your phone, good luck managing your losses.  The only possible way it could be useful is when you’re holding your coins long term, but then you’ll have to worry losing money on conversion and then fees transferring them out. I bet they make a ton of money with how wide the spread is and the difference in conversion. When you’re buying and selling, there are options to convert it to either CRO, USDM, or BTC.  I find the USDM to have smaller conversion difference but good luck with being consistent with choosing it. Those three options get shuffled all the time as if it is designed with the purpose of making you make mistake in choosing their own coin CRO.  The whole thing is sketchy."

The issue was actually in their DeFi wallet app. The customer service rep I worked with in the chat had my problem resolved same day. They walked me through every step and were just amazing. They are always quick to respond too. 

I always recommend this app to everyone who asks me what apps to use or to people on social media asking which app to use. It’s just so easy to use and they have a wide variety of crypto coins to invest in. If you are considering this app, download it! You will be happy that you did."

**So months later I , very much am in awe that it’s not only still bad, but in fact gotten even worse. 
Withdrawals are “pending” for HOURS now. Deposits ONLY show up, after you panic, contact ‘support’ WAIT FOREVER TO HEAR BACK, then ur money shows up, and support tries to make you feel dumb like, “I see your deposit is in your account” 
No kidsing? Just like the last 10 times, it’s in my account SUDDENLY, after I tell you I noticed it wasn’t in my account. 
THAT IS MORE THAN ENOUGH TO SCARE ME  OFF. What a shame. This app was promising for quite awhile. It’s the next FTX you’ve been warned!!!!**

This app was 5 starts easy, until the last 5-6 months. Lately I have had a problem with 75% of all my transactions. Although I was able to receive my crypto deposits eventually, it’s been very frustrating having to hit up support every time I deposit, because my transactions don’t show up otherwise! I’ll see them on the blockchain, confirmed, and not in my wallet. Now it’s also with withdrawal- hopefully this is a fluke thing- but I have had 2 withdrawals in last 2 days both not even initiated after 2 whole hours! That’s not the expectations I have from an app named CRYPTO DOT COM. I would recommend this app over most other wallets until now. I’m pretty much making my way back to another app rhymes with join face. It’s alright. If y’all can’t fix these ongoing issues, why would i continue to use your services??"
crypto.com,ios,AgentAbsurdia,1,2021-04-25 10:23:20,"Do not trust this app. Of all the trading methods I’ve come across this one is by far the worst. Limit amount of currencies that you can actually trade. The layout is confusing, and people seem to only be recommending it based on incentives. 

The market data is also not reliable by a long shot. The graphs never match the actual current prices, and is limited to only an 8 hour snap shot. No zooming in, or getting real time stats. They lure you in with free trades for a month, but after that there’s no way it’s worth paying this company to trade as they offer nothing credible to justify it. Their debit card options are based on their poorly earning in-house crypto that doesn’t hold much value at all. The kicker is that you have to stake a set amount of money to keep any rewards you would benefit from staking. Specially when you end up likely going broke keeping your money with them. 

If your looking for trading crypto look elsewhere. Even the limited options with Robin Hood and Webull still give far more in-depth stats with free trades. Be warned."
crypto.com,ios,CxPTxN,4,2021-11-04 17:14:01,I love this app - new coins all the time and makes it much easier to buy and sell crypto without having to go through swaps. Couple great features they need to add is what your gains/losses is on a crypto. Basically you have to add up what you invested and then subtract that from the value of your investment to see what you’ve gained… not hard to do but other apps have easily showed your gains without having to do all that. Second would be a showing you your positions when you click on the coins from the Home Screen. Right now you have to goto your wallet to see where you’re at instead of just clicking the coin from the Load up page. Which you then need to add up yourself as stated above. Other than that it’s an amazing app that will make some people very very rich! Fortune Favors The Brave!

I have explained in detail the issue, again and again, as the bot asks so that someone can look into it further. No one ever gets back to me. And then about a week later I get an email saying that they notice it’s been a while since my issue and they are closing it out and if the problem persists to contact them again. They never helped at all!! Completely horrid. Their exchange rates and fees are not transparent either. This app is terrible.

Want to buy the coin for at least 10% more than you could on actual exchange? Due to simplicity, al it people choose this disgraceful application to trade cryptocurrencies. I believe in the CRO staking, don’t get me wrong.  However you WILL be overpaying in price and there will be fees for every transaction if you’re using credit.

ACH and wiring funds, you say? Well call it “instant Deposit and they can use the money to buy our crypto!” Except 2 and a half weeks run by and they threaten to liquidate positions because the money hasn’t come through yet. 

Segway to customer support! They have a support team? You could’ve fooled me. God forbid you have to deal with this during your time on the platform. The days-spaced corporate verbal diarrhea is pathetic. I asked about my ACH deposit for a third time, at which I had three days to finalize it according to an email that was sent after the exchange of messages. But guess what? My bank doesn’t have what they need to verify! Run past the deadline and here we are again. Another ACH fund that’s been processing for 2 weeks now and I am inable to send my crypto anywhere else."
crypto.com,ios,Mattnat5960,1,2022-02-03 15:39:34,This app is another measure of ripping people off their hard earned money without considering we are all in a pandemic. I put money on this app from my bank and traded with crypto so it could have gains. As soon the I noticed the market rise and tried to withdrew my gains this app never allowed me to. They requested for a document and after providing it they request for an alternative document and keep requesting. Worst part is their contact support always tells you there is nothing they can do and they ca not share information with you so you have both the account and your money including the gains all gone. They will not allow you to resolve a dispute but always looking for ways to block your account and take your money referring you to their terms and condition that says they can go away with your money if you have issues with your account. This app is shady. Very shady!!! Please take this app down because they are very unprofessional at dealing with dispute and always want to close your money with the account.

Love the card, love the staking benefits, and crypto purchase without fees, but I would really appreciate a greater amount of CRO trading pairs and more advanced market orders. I feel like its one of the areas in which your app lags. I think level 2 market data should also be a consideration but primarily behind more advanced trading orders, the app really needs a refresher visually and with more chart options. I cant really trade when Im just looking at a line without a distinct time frame. You need candles and multipe time frames. take a page from webull or tradingviews book. When you dont give the customer complete control of the price and an inaccurate view of the price action, your zero fees dont matter because you more than likely profit off the difference of market orders and customer orders."

It takes them for ever to reposed with we call don’t have the ability to correct these actions. I my first transaction was declined but it went threw I only wanted one purchase. They are commit fraud. Luckily the banks can resolve this problem but it’s a national holiday so I will have to wait till Monday and follow up with Legal procedures. Be warned.

crypto.com,ios,Joseph R K,1,2025-01-24 17:51:54,"It has been months and I have still not been approved for a cash wallet, meaning I was unable to cash out. After doing proper research you will find many others with a similar experience to mine. 
The majority of the customer support interactions I have had have also been quite poor, with agents often having contradictory information, with one agent being outright disrespectful AND incorrect about the platform they represent. 

I have been left in the dark and “reassured” that my “case had been brought up internally” despite this, they are unable to give me any reason at all as to why my account cannot be approved despite many others platforms verifying my information in minutes, not months, with less documentation provided as well. Not only this, but customer service will close your conversation while you are still waiting to be approved, forcing you to reach back out, be transferred to a specialist with no warning, only for them to reassure you while you wait months to access your funds.

If you for some reason decide to use this platform over another, you must realize you will be forced to transfer your funds to another platform if you would like to cash out, meaning you will be faced with additional fees that could have been avoided. My experience is far from original, and I would recommend everything against this platform, they are not here to help."

This is no insult to Indian people whatsoever I am brown as well however it is very well known that India is the epicenter for Internet scams and credit card fraud companies. An Indian man stating he was from California but he could not describe Burbank to me, insisted on continuing to ask me for information but could not remedy my issues of validation on the website. You must validate through an email to have the software run correctly.

crypto.com,ios,ArtMason,1,2021-05-11 06:41:18,"Idk where to start but just trying to set up an account was painstaking. For starters, the automatic facial image thing didn’t work at all. Just kept saying align my face for a picture. I tried it this way at least 20 times before trying the automatic route. Before that I had to maneuver my phone x different ways just to capture my license! Pushing on, when doing everything manually, once it came time to take my picture and submitting it, the app crashed the second I tapped continue. EVERY TIME!
‘Deep breath’ it eventually worked after deleting and reloading the app. 

However now there’s a different issue. After the first 100 hurdles, I was told my account needed to be verified and etc and I’d be notified in 2-3 days. Cool whatever. My friend said it took her maybe a few minutes to hours so I decided to try my luck. Now this might just be the app trying to wait till I get approved but if I try to log on with my e-mail, I wants to do the little puzzle slide thing “verify you’re not a robot” thing then sends me a confirmation e-mail. I open it and click on it, takes me back to the app. Green screen with a “e-mail confirmed. Hit anywhere to continue” tap the screen and back to the “sign up/log on” page. Like what?! 🤯. This happens every time. Like I said, maybe it’s because my account didn’t verified yet, idk.

Not only was the representative very helpful….they were understanding and truly seemed like getting me my money back was as important to them as it was me. Long story short, I got MOST of my money back (a blessing considering I thought it was gone forever) and learned a valuable lesson.

crypto.com,ios,Crlaozwyn,1,2020-03-22 20:00:55,"These are my initial thoughts, as I’ve only used this app for a few hours. So far, I’m not impressed. 

When signing up, I was asked for my nationality. I entered it and followed their requested steps. The next day, it asked me to resubmit my documents, so I did. After again being asked to resubmit, I reached out to support who told me to check my spam folder. Yep, there’s the rejection, saying that I should ignore my nationality and instead use my country of residence. That’s annoying and two days wasted...

So, I submit different docs and get confirmation within a few minutes. Awesome! I generate a BTC deposit address and send over a small amount for testing. Ten minutes later, I get a notification of the pending deposit, saying the amount will be available once there are two confirmations - pretty standard. Well, there are now four confirmations and my deposit is still pending. For reference, a transaction I sent after this on CoinSwap has already been deposited, which means two separate series of confirmations have completed.

While some of their features are promising, their UI is misleading and backend functionality isn’t working as advertised. Hopefully I’ll be able to update this review with better news soon.

Update: it’s now been over an hour and a half with eight confirmations - and my transaction is still pending.

Update 2: deposit became available between ten and 12 confirmations. That’s pretty bad. We’ll see if I try again later..."

There has been instances where the price is 100’s of dollars more expensive for one bitcoin! Oh you made a little money and are ready to sell now? Just wait until you see how much they will give you. They took 10% of my shiba investment when I sold! If that doesn’t bother you how about trying to open the app and you get an infinite loading screen for hours on end. Your ok with that? How about when you open the app and it tells you that you need to update it before you can continue using the app and it directs you to the App Store and the App Store tells you you are up to date!

crypto.com,ios,nonbiasreviews,2,2024-11-22 14:14:42,It wouldn’t be bad but they make the app intentionally bad to use. There is mo way the app is designed by someone striving for ergonomics and efficiency. The only reason the app is still downloaded on my phone is because of how hard they make it to withdraw money. You cannot withdraw money to your bank account in the same manner you put it in like EVERY OTHER APP. They make it easy to invest with a debit card then a 10 step process to withdraw any earnings and even then if your bank isn’t recognized my PLAID you can’t even manually put in the account and routing numbers. Do not put any money in this app if you ever expect to get it back. I literally have money in the app I can never move outside of the app again unless I go open a different bank account that accepts plaid. They’re thieves. Every good review is fake or old.

I DO NOT want to invest in any more crypto as I am strapped for cash right now, and It is too risky for me to do right now. So I transferred it all to bitcoin, and tried to withdraw it to my external wallet, and it won’t let me because its below the minimum amount of BTC for withdrawals which is .003 (this equals something around $100-$150 right now). I was NOT warned when buying small amounts of crypto that I wouldn’t be able to withdraw it. I contacted customer service about it, and they said theres nothing I can do unless I buy more bitcoin first…which I don’t have the ability to do right now. So it seems like they just took my money, and locked it away so that I can’t reach it. DO NOT USE IF YOUR TRADING SMALL AMOUNTS OF CRYPTO"
crypto.com,ios,Bilbogetthisbaggins,5,2021-05-16 02:29:35,Slowest customer service ever. A week with no response. So if you like to buy or trade often this app is trash. Debit cards and credit cards get declined by cro all the time. Had them charge me for 4 declined transactions. My bank said my card wasn’t blocked by them and that’s why all the charges went through. Took a week to get the coins. Even though they took the money and declined me. Ended up buying 4 times as much as I planned cause they charged me even though it didn’t go through. The reason this is important is when you want to buy during a dip and they keep declining cards and Are unable to be reached ever. You may miss a good time to buy. So sad was very excited to try this app. Will be switching all crypto to another program.

I put in more than several hundred dollars of CRO to lockup (this is not the problem) so I can access a card. The problem is that even though my cro is locked up I still can’t get a card due to the app being too broken to input my SSN and address. I tried speaking with support, they kept saying “kindly, try again” an actual person told me that several times and each time it still failed, the only way I can even input the ssn is by attempting to open the fiat wallet because the crypto card page has the button but that button doesn’t do anything. I tried showing my ID with address to the support specialist and that also made no difference, I did get an email saying it failed so I think they tried the same thing I’m trying.

While it’s nice to have a place to purchase and store crypto that is easily accessible and user friendly for the most part, there is not much that separates this company from its competition, in my opinion.

With few positives, and so many negatives, this app hs certainly lost my business.

They bully users into agreeing with terms and conditions that are entirely unfavorable and unfair to the customer. They appear to offer very favorable terms on their credit cards, but then reveal that those terms are only for those staking large amounts of money. They wanted to charge me a $50 upgrade fee just for upgrading my card, though I never even had a physical card. The false advertising, privacy breaches, and more place this poor company far down on my list.

There is no explanation to the issue, and no solution to the problem. Also, the customer service is awful. They only told me that there was no restriction on the account and they refused to investigate the issue. I tried later and to my surprise, small transfers can be completed. I think they are manipulating the system to impede customers from completing big transfers and force us to make small transfers so we end up paying more in fees. If I’m correct, that’s a shady procedure and they are thieves. I have reported them to the FTC, the FBI and other federal agencies. Thanks god they are regulated by the federal government.

After 3 months of waiting now they want sensitive information such as a bank statement to verify my address when they already have my address. The staking feature is also misleading. It only gives you 2% back after you put in $1000s of dollars. Better off getting a citi card. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS. They collect your very highly sensitive data and hold their free debt card hostage. There is no debt card. It should not take 3 months to ship a debt card. And the come back to say, we need to verify your address. Send us all your personal details. But before then they were stating that they haven’t shipped it due to Covid or a printing issue. You will see their BOT comment below stating to contact customer service.

Every bank I speak to or card issuer informs me that there is no authorization attempt from the app. 

I don’t know how you’re supposed to run a successful business when people can’t even make purchases.

The only thing I can blame on them is the network congestion that has nothing to do with the functionality of the app, which is great.

Be careful because that’s what I’m dealing with currently. I was almost scammed into sending my funds off in an illegal cryptocurrency trade, but before that happened, I was able to figure out the scam and I’m trying to move the money back into my bank account as I’ve already made a deposit.

Then I tried purchasing some and chose to not keep it due to dramatically falling prices and it took me forever and several time reaching out to customer support to figure out how to sell and get my little bit of money back. After selling, I tried to transfer to my bank account and was notified I had to have a minimum of a $100 transfer but of course since the crypto value had fallen so drastically, I didn’t have that and am now just out of that money fully as it sits in the app. Not user friendly at all, but I will say customer support is kind and friendly and always willing to help"

Once downloading the app, i obviously wanted to buy crypto … so i added money to the card… but the card they give CANT BUY CRYPTO lol what a joke … So once i realize the card is pointless, i decide if I’m gonna have it i might as well upgrade to get the rewards… so i upgraded based on the ad on my app… The moment i clicked upgrade, my entire balance disappeared…. I have been trying to get my money back sense…. They keep saying they have to transfer the balance …. Like from THEIR old card yo THEIR new card. I’m 8 days into this process, bills are due lol and they are holding my money hostage… Lastly i can go put money and the new card the moment it was issued … but for some reason they can’t return my balance for 8 days!? Nor do you get any real answer about when you will get it"
crypto.com,ios,eyewrench,1,2021-11-07 13:59:46,"I would not recommend this app for someone wanting to purchase crypto, as it’s lacking some of the most basic features an investor in crypto would want. For instance, your cost basis is not displayed - if you want to find out your average cost for a position, you have to crank out the math and add up all your individual transactions the painstaking way. The app also doesn’t display your overall percentage up or down, or dollar value up or down, on a position. Additionally, there’s a glitch with the SHIB display where it’s not showing the original transaction conversion in dollars. The items mentioned above are some of the most essential, expected pieces of data one finds on all other brokerage apps, but one doesn’t find it here, even though it would be so easy for the developers to add - for some odd reason they just haven’t done it. I don’t know if it’s laziness or obstinance or what. Very disappointing, I think I’ll look elsewhere."
crypto.com,ios,collage m day,5,2021-10-11 03:09:32,Horrible customer service! All done online via chat with no available number to call. They lost my account attached to my email and now stating the issue is on my end. They have been working on this issue for 2+weeks stating they will contact me when resolved but after 2-3 days of no update I message back to follow up and they start the entire verification process over again with selfie and other info only to not come up with an answer and delay by stating they are still working on issue. This happens repeatedly each day I contact them this process starts from the beginning. I would never use this app or company to trade or buy crypto with!
crypto.com,ios,Oops 13,3,2025-01-01 23:28:05,Not as easy as you’d expect. You won’t be able to buy right away. Transferring money gets blocked by banks. Ach didn’t work. Credit card didn’t work. Debit card didn’t work. Direct transfer once set up worked. However if you purchase crypto and have a remainder it doesn’t let you transfer more funds right away if at all to buy anything else. States not enough funds where you’d deposit from your bank account otherwise it wants to liquidate your crypto for the sale. Alerts for prices can’t notify your phone. You need to monitor your email 24/7. Might as well watch the screen. It’s also loaded with senseless badges and distractions. The favorite button doesn’t display what you favorited but a majority favorites list. Kind of a weird app for the popularity of 5 star reviews.

Little did I know the company doesn’t have a phone service. They only have the stupid bot service. that loops you in an endless conversation about nothing. once I realized this, I tried to close my account little did I know there’s no way to do it on the app. so I had to contact customer service unfortunately. it has now been two days since I decided to close this hellhole of an account. And have yet to have the problem resolved. I actually did have someone contact me back on the app only to tell me that I would be  contacted via email. which was really annoying because they could have used that time to actually solve my problem instead of telling me that. I honestly believe the customer service team for this company is a joke."
crypto.com,ios,PloppyJoe89,4,2021-12-03 05:59:53,"Hopped on the app after a few friends recommended it and was initially intrigued. Invested in a variety of crypto but then for a 3 day stint the app would glitch every time I would buy and only go through intermittently, requiring me to redo transactions dozens of times. There is also no quick and easy interface to track initial investment and ROI at a quick glance. The daily swing percentages are cool but we all care more about our wallet health and being able to quickly ascertain it! 

I agree with other users that the UI needs a definite upgrade (see above). Overall though has a lot of potential and I like the wide breadth of coins available. True rating 3.5 stars. Fix a few things and 4 star and beyond app for sure"
crypto.com,ios,srsimpson727,3,2021-03-09 01:00:25,"This app is definitely not the worst. They offer a prepaid metal Visa card that you can load with your crypto wallet which is pretty awesome. It’s one of my favorite features, but my big hang-up is that I was losing significant amounts of money on trades and couldn’t figure out why. I finally realized that their graphs follow closely with crypto prices but aren’t exact - usually they’re above the actual prices. So when you sell, you tend to receive a lower amount & when you buy, you pay their advertised higher amount. I’ve time stamped some screenshots of this issue for reference where there was an advertised difference of $250 on Bitcoin prices. As a user if you’re going to invest long-term, this is a great app, but if you plan to day trade you may lose money. That being said, I still plan to use this app. The good definitely outweighs the bad if you know what you’re doing."
crypto.com,ios,Sol2652,1,2021-11-20 18:44:19,I just want to come here and warn people of what to expect when dealing with this company. While I was trading on this app there were hidden fees! At one point I withdrew all my money from this trading service. Recently months later I saw a transaction made on my account which I did not make! Which means security is a major issue. When I emailed them to delete my account they told me they would not delete my account without me taking a selfie photo holding a sign that read my name the date and close delete account which I did not want to provide as I don’t know what they would do with a picture of me or why they would need this. They didn’t need this to open the account this is a corrupt business with shady practices if this is where you want to invest your money good luck! Why they would need a selfie of me for for authentication is beyond me and absolutely ridiculous in 2021! Mind you there is 0 dollar balance.

And o boy, i never experienced something like that,
First it takes 2 day for some to answer your, this person texted me at 11:30pm, I was a sleep and she terminated the conversation i text back and again waiting to se if one day y can get my money out 
So be careful don put money here that you think you will get back at least no fast"
crypto.com,ios,Prh84,5,2025-03-03 13:58:49,The app the card everything is a joke. I’ve even compared the strike option with my husbands phone and when I used it it went the other direction and for on the other phone it was going the opposite of mine… how does that make sense! Also I transferred an “instant transfer” and almost two weeks now and my funds are not available yet but I can lose them to bitcoin (wth is up with that) I wish I could give 0 stars. Couldn’t even use my card at the salon and was so embarrassed even though I had over $120 on my card to use but they said it wasn’t approved vendor which is ridiculous!!!!
crypto.com,ios,to much ads boi,2,2021-06-06 03:04:05,"So, their referral bonus claims to provide you with $25 and the person you have referred, when they sign up. Awesome. What they don’t tell you, is that you don’t get that $25, until they have invested $4000 into crypto coin and reserved their metal card. Which, requires you too invest the $4000. It’s a dirt bag move, because you don’t know this, until you have signed up completely. The app is fine, but that’s just a dirty business move and makes the company seem untrustworthy. Get rid of the bonus in all, or just make it $5 for signing up. How does, giving people a card and $25. Equal to us putting $4000 into a crypto that is not even that popular? I’m not saying people entitled to anything, but just get rid of in all. If someone is going to invest that much money in your coin, I highly doubt they give a crap about $25 or a metal card."
crypto.com,ios,Seeping Blister,1,2021-06-04 01:40:07,"When I go to sell, the total I own is suddenly less than I just owned. Like it says, you have $5 in cryptocurrency, then you go to sell and it’s like okay where do you want your $4 to go?  Supposedly during the 30 day period of ‘waiving’ their  fee? Plus when I bought it, it was at 15 and then when I owned it, I somehow bought it at 20 even though it never made it to 20 during the day I bought it? Coinbase was a dream compared to this rapist app. None of these ‘surprises’ happened there, these are just in your face bend over muggers. They caught the wave of people rushing into this blindly hoping they didn’t miss their chance. I only went here because they had some currencies that coinbase didn’t. They know what they’re doing. And in the end they have to own up to it. I like their free money offer - but only if you get their credit card, and the money comes in their own currency. Gross."

 When attempting to login, an error message comes up saying to contact support. Took over 5 weeks and over 20 emails for me to finally get a response as to why I could not log into my account. Emails initially took 3-5 days to get responses and I included every reply in the email string thinking, I would not have to repeat the same information. 

 The first 8 emails I was asked if I was still having the issue since it’s been a few days since they responded. They asked me to respond if I still was having the issue. I would say yes. After 3-5 days again, they would ask if I was still having the issues since it’s been a few days again. It was an endless loop of ridiculousness. 

 Later they transitioned to asking me for information to verify account ownership. It was provided in 8 emails just be asked the same question again, please provide the following information to verify your account ownership. In the last couple of emails they then said information needed to be uploaded to verify account. Again, my issue was that I could not log into my account. 

 Ineffective and nonsensical customer support team."
crypto.com,ios,BuddyLoveATL,1,2021-05-27 21:44:28,"They make it very easy for you to put your money into the app however, you may never get your money out until they update their platform to do manual accounting and routing withdrawals which should be a standard! API integrated software doesn’t allow this so you so your money will be stuck in their app until they fix this. They tell you banks on the list do withdrawals but all the banks got smart and start blocking third party Authentication logins so the list of banks all fail to authenticate. Then when you reach out to chat the repeat/copy and paste the same message over and over again instead just telling you, you’re fcuked! They won’t even tell you what banks won’t block you so good luck giving them your money and never getting to see it again. The only thing they going to do is say hey, email us and when you do they respond 2 days later every time you reply. Wild goose chase!"

What I have in there will sit until I move to cold storage.  Basically, this app went from something I ran thousands of dollars a week through, using it basically every where I go, to a HODL account that will never get another deposit from me.  I feel like I am about to lose a ton of money.  I hope I am wrong.  But, my fiat Bank of America card now has better rewards that this card.  That is pathetic.  I wouldn’t recommend getting involved in this company.  They have already been bought out.  Really disappointed."
crypto.com,ios,sowens20007,2,2024-09-27 13:20:46,"At first, the app was great. I loved all of the options available that I have not found on other sites, the promotions and contests were exciting and engaging, the live updates on pricing was a nice feature to watch.

But, as you use the app, you notice that the active price they show is ALWAYS inflated when compared to other apps or places across the internet, so you pay more. Then, as I buy BTC I transfer it to my hard wallet. This morning they charged me .0006 BTC or $39 to move .0028 BTC or $160 approx. That is about a 25% transfer fee. I went back and looked at other transactions here and they charged similar. I checked on withdrawal transactions from other exchanges that I have completed and this is way above and beyond what many are charging by a large margin. I feel robbed and will not be doing business with them any longer."
crypto.com,ios,QueenOfCrypto,1,2021-01-10 11:05:23,"This happened a year ago or so. I had a bad experience with this app & lost money. I noticed unauthorized charges happening on my bank account from Gibraltar (a place I’ve never visited) that were affiliated with this app. When I brought it to their attention, they banned my account and access. Fortunately, I notified my bank first.  Customer service is not on top of things at all. It takes too long to get a response and issues are not even resolved when they finally do respond. I only trusted this website because they seemed reputable from a cypto conference that my friend attended in the Bay Area. I liked the fact they offered the card but now it’s useless since I can’t access the funds I put on it. I’m thinking Nexo might be more reliable in that regard when their card is made available. I would never trust this website again. Unauthorized charges were made numerous times."
crypto.com,ios,br3n7yn,1,2020-11-17 19:29:45,If youre looking for an app to invest money into only to never be able to pull it out because every single bank you try to link your account with magically doesn't work correctly or somehow just has an error! If you're looking to also invest 50 dollars with no fee only to see it really invested only 45 for some reason and never be told where the 5 went this is the perfect app for that! Money goes missing and your money becomes forever inaccessible by you and you get to watch some numbers on a screen forever knowing they'll always have your money and there is nothing you can do about it because youll just run into another rabbit hole of issues whenever you try and take out your earnings or get your randomly disappearing cash without explanation of where it is! I would highly recommend this app to anyone looking to invest and never see it again!
crypto.com,ios,Crypto.com review,1,2025-03-16 14:58:49,I loved this app for a lot of reasons the fees to get my money on here was a little high since I transferred it over but I truly like the app. Now I’ve withdrawn my money so I can buy a home. All my funds got to my bank however when I look for a transaction history the only thing the app offers is a very basic looking excel chart. A document I sent to the bank and they won’t accept it because it looks like a document I could’ve  made. This should be something very basic that any financial institution should provide to their clients specially when holding their money. How is it possible you guys don’t provide a monthly financial statement to have proof of their funds? Now I have a good chunk of cash that I can’t use towards my home. I have asked support and they have said this is the only documentation they can provide me. Very unfortunate situation
crypto.com,ios,j_vena,1,2025-02-11 01:04:32,"I say sleezy instead of scammy because these guys won’t outright steal your money. They will nickel and dime you with higher fees than most. They also overestimate coin values to drive hype. And they won’t let you close your account. 

I transferred out as much as I could, but they kept ~$1 worth of crypto in the account which they said I couldn’t transfer out. I tried closing the account, and they said I can’t close the account while there is still a balance. But because I am below the minimum withdrawal limit, they said I have to deposit more money in order to withdraw all the money and subsequently close my account. If I did that, by the way, they would make sure to take a fee from my withdrawal which would be greater than my current remaining balance. And I’m not convinced they would allow me to withdraw all of it since they caused this issue by not allowing me to withdraw all the money anyway."
crypto.com,ios,Patrickh1756,1,2021-05-24 20:25:57,"I’ve never gave a review, but this app is so bad that I had to. 
First off, it took a week to make an account because the app crashes every time I tried to confirm my email. 
Secondly, after I finally managed to create an account, it takes me forever to actually open the app. I have to close and reopen at least 5 times before the app finally opens, and sometimes it doesn’t even open then. It only shows me the opening logo. 
Lastly, a major problem (if you can get this far) is trying to fund your account. I’ve tried funding my account from 3 different bank accounts, but all of them report it as a security threat. Yes, you could say that it’s my bank’s fault or that I could spend another day trying to fix this, but surely the app developer could fix this problem if they want to be a professional crypto exchange. In my opinion, this app needs a lot of work."
crypto.com,ios,KickingCoach,1,2021-03-16 05:14:39,"I began experimenting with Crypto and opened an account with this app last week. I found an app that works better for me and have been trying to withdraw my money from this app and close my account. I was not made aware during signup that I would not be able to withdraw amounts less than $100. I do not have $100 in my account and do not intent to have $100 in my account. I have contacted customer service three times. Twice in the app and once through email and have not gotten a response. It’s my money so I should not be told I cannot withdraw my own money if I have less than $100 in my account.

Ps. Finally got a response and they still refuse to refund my money. I became very frustrated and used some choice words in one of my emails to them and their customer service person actually scolded me for talking like that. They’re literally more concerned with how I talk than they are with helping me out."
crypto.com,ios,tyiouubnn,5,2021-05-12 04:44:04,I have 4 friends that got approved within a hour the same time I applied and received screen saver that reads 2-3 days . I have since then seen a continuous screen image of 2-3 days when I see my colleagues getting approve within minutes if not hours.  I have no idea what this company is doing if your trying to supply a service during a high interest event as crypto is I would think you would be prepared for amount of volume coming in the door. And sending a blank statement 2-3 days when I have colleagues around me getting approved left and right makes me question the make up of the organization and business your running terrible business.
crypto.com,ios,Zergination,2,2025-02-09 05:44:57,"The app is limited. They added stocks and sports betting instead of enhancing and building off of the crypto platform. There is no where to find fees charged, no information on bid vs ask price, no way to tie in a live portfolio tracking app, little information about airdrop for Cro returns (I put in $130 worth of Cro for a $0.13 return in a month. In that time the Cro dropped 10% or more). Their app made it look like I would get a 6% return instead of a .1% return. 

The presentation of where your assets are at is poor. If you have a sell order on a coin it won’t appear in your crypto portfolio. 

You can set up 2 factor authentication but not with a YubiKey or other security key. Also, there’s little response from customer service. In short there is so much room for a new competitor to grab US customers or for this app to grow. 

After posting my first review I got an email denying me from depositing more money into the app. I then got another email about changing my review or contacting the developer. The link to contact the developer only had a link to articles on the site but no place to contact the developer or customer service. The articles had nothing about setting up a security key with 2FA. Due to this I’m lowering my rating from a 3/5 to 2/5."

I am having a problem with a relatively small deposit around $500 after making dozens and dozens of other deposits now this one is being not located in their system. Well this is it for me.

I took screen shots of the graph and screen shots of their trade value and contacted customer service.

The response I got was “the graph is only an estimate and not the true value of the coin” I lost my $500. 

It doesn’t make sense for them to show me a graph of the value of the coin and then later tell me that the graph doesn’t actually mean anything. Total bull. I’m not new to any of this, I was looking at different graphs of the same coin on different sites and the value was correct.

Ever time I have had an issue the team responds with in hours and they have also been helpful and polite.  The nicest thing is that it is great not to use a traditional bank (all the fees and charges and no interest on savings to speak of).  I recommended to all my family and the card is quite flash and does definitely start conversations about crypto.  People are surprised how far crypto has come along over the last couple years.  Great product and great to make interest on my coins waiting for the right time to sell.

Edit: they left me a review to contact them. I did contact them through chat. I even sent my bank statement as proof and they refuse to accept they stole my money by charging me a fee. They claim they didn’t but my statement and my bank both conclude it went to them. Would not recommend risking it with this company. They are very rude. It also took them 1-2 days to get back to me and tell me my bank is wrong. They just point fingers and do the “check with your bank, it’s not on us” even though it’s obvious that if the statement says where the money went and the bank confirms it went to them that it went to them.

They don’t have a customer service number to remedy anything with an actual representative. You have to “chat” or “email” correspondence with their team. So as of now I have shares in limbo on this app without any way to move it around. Still waiting on an email back, and multiple chat questions pending with a status of “not read”. Frustrating.

Found out this app is a scam. STAY AWAY. Let me say it again, STAY AWAY. You are subject to being locked out of your own account without any way to contact support. It is impossible to move your shares after this happens. The funny thing is you can watch you shares succeed with no way of interacting with it. Do yourself a favor and find an app that uses cold storage. I will gladly pay dumb fees as long as I know there is security behind it.

Once they realized the mistake I switched off of the Wi-Fi, problem solved. After sending negative email I received a response within 24 hours asking to resolve the situation.

crypto.com,ios,JoshuaMagdzak,1,2021-04-15 12:26:27,"To be honest, I downloaded this app a few years back and stop using it due to the horrible customer service response and had switched to Coinbase.

Recently however, I learned about their debit card program and it’s benefits so I figured I’d give them another go. What a horrible idea that was! 

I noticed upon completion of my application that it hadn’t let me submit an address for shipping the card so I contacted their support center only to start a long uphill battle that would last me an entire day and still remain unresolved. I wanted to change my address for shipping but they had claimed it’s too late and because the address they have on file isn’t valid they’re not going to send the card regardless. I had asked for a refund of my money and they say they’re still going to hold it even though they can’t hold up their end of the bargain!

After being left on read countless times, my questions denied being answered, submitting countless documents and photos I still couldn’t get them to send me a card. They left me on read for hours trying to complete a simple task. When I would ask for a manager I would be ignored every time.

It’s just a horrible experience and it’s unsafe for individuals to use.

Don’t mess with this company or this application."
crypto.com,ios,BobbyRobby1310,1,2020-11-14 08:52:28,I downloaded this app after hearing about the card involved and being interested. The process to get the card is to make an investment of a certain amount into their currency. That’s fine and I did that but it’s the first step in the application. I stay in military barracks and we receive our mail at a UPS store where I have a mailbox. I have received a debit card here and this is where I receive mail. Customer service is absolutely not willing to send the card anywhere but my physical address despite me informing them that it will not be delivered. Customer service has been overall unhelpful and the lack of an ability to speak to a person on the phone is frustrating. It’s odd that someone that really wants to give them their business is being stonewalled like this. The investing side of the app works and seems to run well but I am very frustrated with the customer service and process as a whole.

When I click on profile, it tells me to resubmit my verification information like SSN number and Address. I logged out and tried to logged back in hoping it would fixed the issue, but after inputting my information it takes long to load and after it finished loading it tells me to try again. On the last time I told me to try again, I tried and it tells me to contact customer service. Very frustrated.

To get it unfrozen involved a kinda silly verification process (pic of me holding my debit card), but it took them all day to even review it. Meanwhile my ETH was stuck in limbo (the froze the transfer too), and it took me five hours to get in touch with customer support. Once they finally responded (very helpful and patient CS rep, especially since I was quite irate), they were able to unlock my account and process my transfer within a couple more hours. I’m all for good fraud protection, but if your standards for freezing someone’s account is so low, then you need to have a much faster way of resolving the issue. Seven hours is an eternity when dealing with cryptocurrency, and I could have lost a lot of money."

When I purchased the contract it would automatically be down $40-60 even if the price was going the direction I was thinking it was going to go.  So if I buy a contract for btc to go up and it’s goin up the second my contract fills. It shows a loss of $40-70 dollars then it will slowly start to go towards the positive.  Also I haven’t been able to find a chart that follows their price action.  My chart on trading view will be going up and on the chart on this app will show the price going down.  And lastly I stopped using the leverage because when the price is moving up the price of my contract wouldn’t increase , even worse, it would sometimes decrease.  Not sure if this makes sense but don’t do leverage plays they will steal your money"

First it wouldn’t let me sell the crypto I had due to “insufficient funds.” Which makes zero sense. I’m looking at it. I know I own X shares of it. Then it would only let me sell some of it a few days later because some of it was “locked.” I got $25 when I first joined years ago. But now apparently I can’t have that money back when I withdraw. Then it said I needed to add a bank account, even though I already linked my account when I joined. When I tried to relink the account it claimed my bank didn’t exist. When I tried a second time it said there was a big error that would take some time to resolve. All in all, it took me multiple days to finally withdraw my money. After this glitchy, buggy, nightmare, I decided to pull ALL my money out. I don’t trust an app this messed up with my cash."

The selling fees can be over 10% at some times, which is insane as no exchange should be stealing your money like this. When you deposit money in their “crypto earn” it automatically deducted $20 from the starting value. I could go on and on about how terrible this app is. It’s literally a scam. Now I’m stuck with funds in earn that are slowly depreciating with no way to get them out. Their coin is a joke too. Only reason I even have this app is because they are holding several hundred dollars from me. I can’t understand how anyone can justify this scamming. In what world is a simple withdrawal worth a $40 fee? This app should be taken off the App Store and banned in the U.S. As soon as you download this app you are being exploited, avoid at all costs."

After eight business days I contacted support and all they had to say was that they were working on the problem and that MANY OTHER USERS ARE EXPERIENCING SIMILAR ISSUES. After another week of me asking daily for an update the only answer I ever received was they are still looking into the problem. Finally received funds in my bank account after almost an entire month and I immediately deleted the app afterwards. Thankfully I didn’t have a large portfolio with them, from what I’m reading others trying to withdraw larger sums are still being told that the issue is being looked into the further"

1. It says 0% fee on credit card in 30 days but I’m not been told I’ll be charged 5% cash advance fee, which means I check bank and realized I got charged $50 from every 1k trades. This is not friendly to a person who is new like me.
2.My $ is losing every time I exchange from one kind Crypto to another and I don’t even know why. 
3. To withdraw, address verification need to be done first. After ONE MONTH my pending address verification finally passed. Customer service respond my message after 2 WEEKS, which takes way too long. I was upset while waiting.

Buy Crypto, use the card with fiat currency as a prepaid debit card. They are starting an exchange, stake and earn interest on some cryptos.

It’s ridiculous that the only way to find out what your average buy price is, by having to add up all your transactions and dividing that by how many coins you have of each crypto. Especially if you’re buying stuff every week, or when the price drops to average down. It should automatically tell you what your average cost is. It should give you all sorts of analytics of each crypto you own. It should tell you how much money ALL TIME you’ve put in so you don’t have to add up hundreds of transactions to find out exactly how much money you are up or down overall. It’s so ridiculous that it only shows you how much percentage it’s moved the last 24 hours.

It displayed that I was -$165 instead of -$30 as soon as the order was filled. The price for Bitcoin was nowhere near the actual price. When purchasing an updown option they will hit you with a $20-$30 spread going into the trade and again closing your position making it almost impossible to make money. You have to wait for huge runs in your favor to make a profit. It is totally rigged in their favor and when I provided screenshots of their incorrect information they still dismissed me and said nothing was wrong with my trade and that I would not be compensated. STAY AWAY!!!! They just want to steal your money! There are far better platforms out there that have better customer service. Please look elsewhere. Consider yourself warned!

Fast forward 3 months and I am still without a card and told that a new one is on the way. This of course was said without giving an arrival date or tracking number. If there was an issue that is more serious than this I don’t know what I would do."

They also use third a party attach your bank information to their app!  If you stop using this app, change your password immediately.  This is the ONLY app I have ever used, that ask for super personalized information about your bank and your passwords.  It is super scary.  I haven’t tried to sell any crypto, but I am already scared that when I try to cash out my earnings, there will be some weird software glitch preventing me from gaining my profits until its under market.

When you reply to their emails, you get a kickback email telling you to continue the conversation in their message board. The problem is that conversation is locked leaving you no way to speak with anyone. I suggest using one of the other platforms out there where you’ll be able to receive help when you need it.

They’ve now asked me to re-submit my documents for a 3rd time. It’s been over two weeks trying to get approval. They provide no means of direct contact in order to work through whatever issues they are having. You just have to sit idle and wait. Truly a broken system."

I highly recommended you keep your money away from these people because when you have a problem it will take weeks/months for a response and even at that point your problem won’t be solved. I submitted a support request with multiple questions and received a response weeks later asking if I still needed help.

So I tried again a couple days later this time waiting 20 minutes for someone to get back to me. When they did I responded immediately then waited 10 minutes for another response. Again I responded immediately but kept having to wait 10+ minutes for each response. I got 7 responses back within an hour and twenty minutes. By far the worst customer service I’ve ever experienced.

You might also note the duplicate 5* reviews posted under different pseudonyms (I have the screenshots). Go figure. Rest assured, there’s a vague diplomatic response here. Meanwhile, the only way to get my money out was to convert to usd move to card and spend it. Incredibly inconvenient, particularly mid bull run. Find a more accountable and responsive alternative.

This has competitive rates however compared to other big exchanges however and can be done easily. I had no problems with KYC and account setup.

4. Support takes forever to reply
5. To transfer funds to the crypto card is not an easy process
6. I like the hide your balance feature, that’s cool
7. Getting a statement for tax purposes? Ha, good luck.  In their faq section basically says, you’re on your own.  Great support ...
8. The website is just marketing for the app, there’s no actual website to sign on. Unless I’m missing something then it’s because it’s not easy to find.
9. The giveaways are cool but seem more scammy as there is really no proof of anyone actually winning anything ...
10. They have some work still.  I would suggest you do your due diligence and if you still use them, track your transactions otherwise you’ll have quite the work to do...

Not a bad app but not as great a their marketing makes it out to be. Will I still use them? Yes? Why? Because I have faith they will read this and improve or fall behind and never be # 1."

Maybe slow down the marketing until you fix all the issues. I see that many users still have not gotten the cards, and yet you guys keep pushing out ads to attract new users."

I have been using them for years and now when I have issues they are nowhere to he found. I just would like my funds back so I can invest elsewhere. This ridiculous to have wait 6 days for a reply.

Companies like this don’t care about who you are they just see you as a number. Did you know that they can freeze your money anytime they want for any reason they want and they won’t even tell you ahead of time. Every time I login I have to go through the I’d verification process again and then again for every transaction I want to do. No thanks who has the time for that."

[update] it’s been a week since the developer replied to this review meanwhile I’ve been emailing their customer service going on a month now THE BOTS ARE USLESS THEY DNT WORK AND WHEN YOU SEND AN EMAIL IT TAKES THEM OVER TWO WEEKS TO REPLY AND THEY DONT EVEN SOLVE ANYTHING JUST APOLOGIZE FOR THE DELAY… apple should have this app removed they literally holding people money unapologetically and I’m thinking of taking legal action this is getting ridiculous

I’ve already had to reset my passcode multiple times thinking that afterwards I would no longer have the problem but I did anyway. Each time I have reached out it take a long time, almost a whole day a few times. There’s nothing like still getting all the alerts about the coins you’re tracking and then you can’t buy or sell anything 3 or 4 days out of the week because of what I’m assuming is constant software issues."

The app shows prices as higher than every other exchange and so when you buy crypto you pay “their” going rate plus fees, which fees are fine I understand. Now here comes the criminal part, when you go to sell, it seems like they only give you the going rate on other exchanges which is a lot less. On top of that, if a coin spikes in price, the sell price doesn’t change. For example, I had a coin that went up 10%, and it was only giving me the option to obtain a one percent gain on my coin if I sold it at that time. You basically can’t make money on this site. I am in the process of switching to coinbase pro. If I were you I’d do the same."

Oh! downloaded CSV file shows i bought crypto but no transactions for when i transferred it to my wallet. kind of strange also when i checked receiving address for ICP address kept blinking in and out like it was having trouble showing address.

Two of my transactions are successful but the balance never updated. My money is god knows where right now.

The replied on Facebook saying “..we are aware of the balances not being reflected accordingly in the USD Fiat Wallet”. They also mention its being worked on without giving a timeline. So I’m not sure when I’ll get access to that money.

He didn’t listen to what I was saying and just kept repeating the same things not relative to what I was saying the issues were.

Then I have to go all over again the steps login > verify email > create account > phone number is recognized. Customer service is a JOKE!!! I couldn’t reset my password, at one point they, asked me to send a screen recording of the steps which I think is very unsecure! They said they’d reach out to me after researching the issue.

First you get ripped off when you buy. They sell to you at a higher price than it it currently trading at. Not to mention there are “fees” on buys and sells. I was trying to sell 40k shares of Vechain at the limit price .0155 and the order sat there for 24 hours and didn’t move. Oh, did I mention I am a trader so I know exactly what I am doing. I have access to level two trades and liquidity that no one else can see. So I thought I would just place a market sell order to get rid of it and because there was plenty of buyers. The market order sold for .140  at $55 loss even though there were plenty of buyers at a higher price and tack on the selling “fees”. I’ll be trading with a real broker from now on."

Unfortunately many of their functions do not work due to a poorly designed  app, complaints about app functionality issues were met with copy page responses that had nothing to do with the problem I was having, and when a person who could actually answer my question contacted me 12 days later the answer was basically… deal with it. They said there was no plans nor any idea of a plan to actually make the function usable. If you are looking to trade crypto, find a different app that actually has functions that work. 

TLDR: they have terrible support (xfinity/Comcast), functions that don’t work and they refuse to even fix. Go elsewhere."

Just wired $ to my fiat wallet for first time. The app is barely working - way too slow. I have been trying to buy crypto, and it won’t let me - says insufficient funds despite plenty of fund that were wired in. Maybe it’s just chance, but this isn’t good. They essentially have a large amount of my money and I can’t buy anything at the moment. And it is a great buy opportunity right now. Totally disappointed."

Eth market limited and stable coins are limited to what you can sell/buy and transfer. That CRO coin can purchase any and everything.  Keep your apologies and sorry to you and your garbage app. After a good 6 months use and réalise the drawbacks, you begin to become annoyed with this crap. Save yourself some headaches use UNISWAP OR ANYTHING THAT IS A TRUE DECENTRALIZED PLATFORM! This is not the one."
crypto.com,ios,MT111111133333777777,3,2020-05-24 06:09:21,"So many things things wrong here, at least for my area in USA. 

“Exchange” won’t work, which means one cannot place limit buys/sells. 
All market buys are +1% in addition to the added cost on the platform as opposed to the actual market value.

I don’t know about everyone else, but I detest starting an investment at a loss. This is what will always happens here. 

The navigation through the app is extremely tedious. 

The graph interface is not much to write home about. No bars, 8hour is the minimum amount of time. No zoom, no volume changes. 
App will not tell you the cost per coin but the total of the purchase. This has the effect of hiding the added value they are placing on the coins with respect to the actual market value. I much prefer to see how much I’m purchasing each share/coin for. 

My recommendation is to wait until the kinks are worked out. 

I will increase my rating one the price per coin is adequately reflected in a transaction. 

I will further increase the rating once the app actually has limit sell/buy capabilities.

Overall stressful experience."

I was told to do the same thing over twenty times and they keep telling me try again in a couple of days which is now almost two weeks. I went on twitter and got a quick response just for them to tell me open the chat which just stopped working. If u want to keep your hair just use Coinbase or FTX. Everyone seems like a bot or from some other country reading a script and disregard anything u are explaining to them.

crypto.com,ios,Joel_Davis,1,2019-09-17 12:02:59,"I was one of the first to sign up for early access when the MCO app first launched, and I already have the red metal card from staking 50 MCO for 6 months. I was really looking forward to using my card I waited so long for, but it seems I shouldn’t have gotten my hopes up.

First off, topping up the card is a nightmare. It never should have launched in its current state. It requires that you wire money from your bank to another using checking and routing number (all US establishments charge a transfer fee which costs around $35 at most banks). So each time I’d want to top up my card, it’d cost $35.. not cool. 

Beyond that – as if that part isn’t enough to steer away 99% of potential users – there still isn’t a way to export a transaction summary for tax purposes. So if you do actually load the card and use it often, then you literally have to write out each transaction and deposit on your own. 

I can’t imagine there are many people out there actually using this right now. I mean who wants to waste their time entering each transaction / MCO reward deposit into a spreadsheet to bring to their tax advisor when tax return time comes around? Fix these major issues and I’ll update this review. Until then, I guess I’ll just be using my Apple card."

I would also like to see the bid and ask order book. If I’m selling I would like to see at what price I’m selling and how much i am going to get back. Also doesn’t tell you about the chunk of change you lose when you withdraw crypto from the app. Fix your options table and make it more accurate. Other than that it feels like a scam. You would probably attract much more people to the app considering you guys are one of the few that hasn’t been hit with a fraud inconvenience. The app is ok if your only holding long term and don’t care about the spread or delay. If your a day trader or anything like it. This ain’t exactly it.
crypto.com,ios,jdhdhde,1,2024-12-11 03:18:01,I’d give negative stars but as it is ppl filter out the one stars as being anomalous. This is not an exchange.. this is a site that trades on bait and switch you buy at the rolling price and sell at an “average” that is quite a bit off. Where does the difference go? I bet their pockets. Don’t get me started on derivatives leveraging market.. again they take an average and you strike based on some made up amount which is unrelated to the actual amount.. so its more like a game of chance where the house tends to win. Boy do they have this rip off game to an art.. It seems like actual fraud since they allegedly take the averages you aren’t actually able to willfully take advantage of the momentum of a price change as they seem to be choosing the most advantageous price points..

Now everything i own is worth half less or even a quarter. Also now that everything is cheap and low and cant add money to buy cheap. Upon signing up make sure to not overcharge your cc or debit. Beacuse of the long verifying proccess between every purchase its too slow to buy when u want to and will say the price timed out. Then it will charge your cc even for denied purchases. I was only planning on adding 500 dollars but after all my denied attempts processed three days later i had 3000 $ worth of a coin that was already pumped and dumped so I immediately lost money when it processed.

They should be more honest with the price, you can sell a crypto and with the hidden fee it can drop 10% and you still won’t be able to buy back what you had so they make it hard for regular traders it’s extremely disappointing they they are practically robbing you I want to like them but this is what keeps me from that it has to be like 35% or more move to make anything with this site so I would encourage new users to really look at what they say your crypto is worth compared to what they are giving you then try to buy back your position and you can’t even after it drops"

When I reached out to customer service there is no immediate response, and the only explanation they can give is the system is slow due to high demand.

Also I made a purchase when Doge hit an all time high and my card was charged 3x but I never received all of my coins. Can not find a way to contact a human about the matter. I have disputed it with my bank and am still in the process well over a month later.

Crypto is to volatile to wait a few days. I need my purchase to go through the moment I want to purchase, not days later."
crypto.com,ios,Ghuncho678,1,2021-12-02 15:33:36,Don’t get scammed there is way better apps like coin base binance and so much more this app doesn’t even let you withdraw money I have been trying to verify my identity for over a month they told me to upload everything even bank statement since I uploaded my bank statement 2 weeks ago nobody has gotten back to me when you try to contact them they always say “it’s not my department but they’re working hard to get it fixed” I tried contacting them on everything from twitter to email but none of it works I thought it would be better since it has more cryptos and is growing fast but it’s just terrible even if you still decide to invest using this app please whatever you do don’t ever invest before they fully verify your info also when you sell they sell it for less than the market value
crypto.com,ios,mereview333,3,2021-12-01 18:50:08,"I like the app for its earn/staking options. The % is high and there are lots of coins available. However, every step seems difficult to use. Had to reach out to figure out how to get money in the app, so that was cumbersome and annoying, but got that done. Now it’s requiring 2 factor authorization, and cant get that to work either. Does not work as the Step by step guide says, so now im going to have jump through hoops and reach out to get this part fixed too.

I do still recommend this app, but just be prepared for extra work to get up and running with it…
I would give 3.5 stars but since i cant, its getting 3 not 4 from me. Definitely not in the 5 star range yet."
crypto.com,ios,bwjakc fb,2,2021-10-11 12:28:24,"Been using for about a year if not more. If you’re not a fan of fees I’d definitely move on. When you buy a coin it’s magically a higher price when you go to pay for it. That’s on top of a 3% fee for cards. Then when you go to sell that same coin, it’s magically way lower than the actual market price. Funny how that works? They take so much money for gas fees, etc. I bought a coin at its high, and somehow the sale shows it higher than its all time high??? How does that work? And then if I go to sell it, the app is taking another $10-$12 off of the total balance of the coin. Basically anytime you have a balance over $1200, expect it to be $70-$100 lower depending on how many coins you have once you sell it. Amazing how that works."

I have a utility bill, identification, and a bank statement, where all of the addresses and they still have not got this issue resolved. Do not trust them.

Biggest drawbacks for me...The main one is prices. Often times the price I see is not the price I pay when I want to purchase. Also, the price I see is typically not the price I am allowed to sell at (I almost always sells for lower than the price I see). That’s really disappointing to me. 

What’s more, there are price discrepancies in 3 different places. The front page price is different from the price you see when you click a coin, is different from the prices you see on the “tracking” tab."
crypto.com,ios,Fame_O,1,2023-08-07 04:15:38,"I got caught up in the crypto craze a few years ago, when Dodge and Bitcoin were rallying in the markets. When I signed up, I couldn’t believe all of the information they want: a selfie, your drivers license, and bank passwords and routing numbers. I got cold feet and didn’t complete the process. I asked several times for this company to delete my information and account, and they refused. I would say that is highly suspect. My last point is this: be very careful giving away all of your most valuable information. Identity theft is real. You can wake up tomorrow and have your entire bank account wiped out, and what are you going to say in your defense: That you gave all of your personal and banking info to an anonymous crypto app. Don’t be so naïve and stupid. Wake up. Don’t be a statistic. The world is ruled by scam artist."

This app would’ve gotten five stars if not for constantly having to update the app. It might not be that big of an issue, however, you’re unable to login unless you update the app. The feeling that you can’t access or even SEE that your money is safe is unnecessary and extremely frustrating. I thought they were just working out the kinks, at first. Years into this now and, nope. Just tried to open the app only to be told to download the latest version.

If you really want something to frustrate you and waste your time, try asking their support team to help you get through. They’ll suggest all kinds of things for you to do and all sorts of hoops for you to jump through rather than try to fix it on their end, because these are a bunch of people who don’t know what they’re doing.

Wel the minimum limit is now $8..... 

I have $30 in Bitcoin, and I can’t transfer it out, I can’t sell it for another crypto, I can’t access MY MONEY no matter what I do!!

This is the only platform I’ve had problems with and those problems are big enough for me not to want to be a part of it. There are so many superior platforms then this one. You’ll figure that out once you’re treated the same way I was. 4.6 rating is wayyyy to generous. I’m sure they have ppl leaving fake reviews to boost their rating. Good luck 👍🏽

So then I wanted to move all my coins to that app but then i got a new phone and forgot about the 2FA so I wanted to get it reset. I started a chat with the bot 3 days ago but haven’t heard anything so I sent an email only for it to be closed immediately due to me having already starting a chat with the bot.

I have contacted the support but no one got back to me after more than 72 hours. I checked Reddit and found out that many other users are experiencing the same email issue and also being ignored by the support team for more than 2 weeks.

It is also riddled with gimmicks—I feel like I’m being spammed constantly with side gimmicks and challenges when I open this app. It is also very difficult to find very simple information in a concise way that you would be accustomed to with any traditional brokerage. For example there’s no way to see all of your gains/losses for the day and inception to date, total current value, and cost basis for all your coins on the same screen. I’ll definitely be looking for another app to transfer to. Note as well that most of the reviews are fake.

Here is an example. I sold ATOM for $34.7 but in the buy page it had a price of $35.5. That is a fee difference of 2.3%. That is a very high fee compared to 0.1% that BinanceUS charges. I found a page on their website that has a fee table but deceptive as well. According to the table, they charge a max fee of 0.4%. That would have been reasonable fee if It were true.

If I see a mint on Polygon and only have Solana I can swap one for the other and still make it to mint on time. Not wealthy or even comfortable financially.

The interface could use a little more friendly facelift for novice users to help navigate the app better but after investing some in exploring the app, you’ll find your way around.

Also it doesn’t make sense that I cannot transfer the money back into my cryptocurrency that should be something that is implemented but probably not gonna happen. Furthermore I feel like this app is not ready for the world or the app is not ready all the way I feel like this app should be able to be diverse where it can switch hands back-and-forth with currency and physical money but it does not know how to do that and I highly recommend not getting this card.

I might be a one off case, but the bottom line is that they are snakes. Pure thieves. They can terminate anyone’s account whenever they please with zero reasoning. It’s in the terms and conditions. You’re better off using coin base or literally any other wallet.

After looking at some of the other reviews, it seems to have happened to other people. Don’t listen to all these other 5 star reviews. This company does not care about its clients, and will easily rob you blind."
crypto.com,ios,GianniP13,1,2021-03-10 17:25:20,"I purchased 2,000 shares of DOGECOIN before the spike and when I tried to sell, it transferred my shares into Bitcoin, when I realized what happened I quickly changed it back, but in the process I lost over 150 shares of Doge. I still cannot figure out how to just sell out and take my loss already and never use this app again. I tried customer service but I’ve been waiting over a week for one simple message back on how to sell. So I’ve just been losing even more money than I should’ve, when all I wanted to do was sell at the beginning instead of transferring. Terrible app, worse design, do not ever get this app, if I could do less than 1 star I would. Probably even worse than robinhood in my opinion because at least I could still sell on that app. Do not download this app it is only a headache."

So I called my bank and got an account activity letter showing everything they wanted. They still rejected my deposit . I requested a refund immediately . It’s has been over a week I still have no refund in my account . I email them and for 3 days they say it has been sent to my bank. Still no refund . I email 4 more days and all of a sudden someone emails me and says they are working on it . This company will steal your money . I have filed a report with the FBI and the SEC as of today. Do not send them your money or do any type of business with them
crypto.com,ios,DueceHussle,5,2021-04-02 03:30:23,"I had to write a review. This is the easiest place to buy some of the mid sized cryptos like NEO & ICX outside of Binance. Because I live in Texas, Binance isn’t available so I can settle for this and sleep well at night. Binance is superior, Coinbase is superior for the big coins & this is what you need for mid to small sized coins. That’s why I named it the silver package because binance would be the platinum package & coinbase the gold package. This is inferior to those two

If you’re new to crypto & don’t understand you can’t swap coins you have to sell ETH to BTC or USDT etc then this isn’t the place to learn. If you’re familiar, this is an easy place to navigate"
crypto.com,ios,Spydermonkey199,1,2021-05-20 02:23:45,"Reasons:
1. Can’t do limit orders(this alone should turn most away).
2. Servers are big enough for the amount of users. Was trying to sell at the start of a dip multiple times, which is when other active users will also be trading, and the servers were overloaded to the point that I couldn’t get a simple sell at market price order to go through for 70 minutes which turned my $80 dollar loss into a $250 dollar loss.
3. The exchange rates are not accurate, seeming to always skew against you
4. It seems like they skim extra off the top of each trade (can’t prove this in anyway, just my personal observation)

Positives
1. 30 days no fees
2. User friendly for the most basic crypto traders who have just started for their first time(anyone who has traded any other securities won’t be happy with how limiting they have made it)

Side note: if you have never traded anything before and this is your first time opening a crypto account this app could work well for you, but within a month or even a week you will want more capabilities for trading so I would recommend just starting on a better app. There are plenty!"

The dashboard is visually appealing with an Arcadian (80’s gen.) with less pixel distortion with highlighting caption box’s to add tone. Basically, I can see the numbers clearly. I get to click (and I do mean Tap lol )on a performance list of order top performers to lower tier performers.

Exchange says I need to allow my submitted documents pass review!! How I’m I able to trade and made close to $12k in purchases yesterday?? This is some scam app please because people.

Now they have locked me out of my account and continue to tell me the only way to unlock it is to send them a letter from my bank that doesn’t exist.  They want a cancellation of dispute of the charges.  My bank has already refunded my money. I have sent them a summary of the dispute but it is not good enough. They want a copy of a letter that doesn’t exist and will hold my money hostage till get get it.   This is not right and a total scam.   Please do yourself a favor and learn from my loss. Do NOT use this company.  I will create a reddit link and share on here with screen shots of the multiple conversations ive had and how not helpful they are to work with. Give me a few days.

Support has no idea when they will reactivate the account and my money is just stuck now on their exchange. Support claims they take security seriously but their logic when it comes to security is severely flawed! That’s like inviting someone to your home, shooting them in the leg when they enter, ask for their ID, then apologizing later, claiming you just take security seriously! An absolute joke of an exchange and I’ve never been so angry with an app. Cash App works flawlessly... hmmm, I wonder why they can handle things but this joke of a company is clueless.

Eventually, I was asked to remove my crypto to an external wallet within 5 calendar days due to changes to their Customer Acceptance Policy.  I was able to successfully remove all my crypto and the team went above and beyond to make sure I could retrieve all of it.

I had to stay up until 2 AM just so I can actually talk to them even tho I made a request around 9-10 AM the previous day.

It’s as though they give you the lowest sell price for the session and the highest buy price. I transferred all of my money off once I closed my positions. This was also expensive, even using CRO, and the amount received doesn’t match the amount sent minus the withdrawal fees. There are much better platforms that offer an actual exchange with different order types. This app is very deceitful. Don’t be tricked by the fact that they respond to reviews.

But hey. The only bummer is they do charge a cc fee for using cc. It seems to be cheaper than the gas fee. Plus they have many different cryptos you can choose from, unlike some other platforms which only have the higher profile cryptos. Like the “green arrow” one. So far, piece of cake!

This company used to be really good but it’s just one restriction after the next with new T&C’s and app updates every other week.

So many problems recently, also sent my crypto in and took them two days before crediting me the amount, and the customer support is terrible, extremely slow response and bad advice- it’s better not listen to them."
crypto.com,ios,Dinev85,1,2021-05-11 23:51:42,"First, let’s start with how confusing this app is for a first time purchaser of Bitcoin. It was such a process to get approved and get started with the app, only to not be able to purchase crypto with my cards or acct for at least a couple month's and after several attempts of trying to purchase crypto, I kept getting declined. 

After some success, I then tried to send money through my Fiat wallet to my personal USD bank account. It has now been over two months and I still have not received my funds in my account. I have reached out to their customer service chat support numerous times now and I still haven’t received a response.  Very disappointing and untrustworthy.

I do wish they showed the change in how much you’ve made since your initial investment better. Almost like how cash app does with their stocks. But most of the time I’m not able to buy when I want. Maybe it’s my cards but none of them want to work and always say “authorization failed” (yes I have enough money for the transaction). It worked better when I first downloaded it but now it just doesn’t want to work most of the time. Even after deleting and downloading the app."

I’ve already made money on this platform and purchased a drink with the card. 

Don’t get me wrong, it’s something you have to really mess around with to fully understand the functionality. DONT FORGET, if you want to send someone coins you have to download the DeFi wallet. 

All in all I’m excited to see where crypto and this platform go in the future. Wherever it is I’ll be there to support."
crypto.com,ios,DirtyNut,1,2021-03-09 01:03:02,"This is by far the worst exchange app I have used to date and I’ve tried many. All though they support a large number of cryptos, it has many draw backs.

1. You can not place buy and sell limit orders.
2. It’s nearly impossible to ascertain how much profit you’ve made, you need to do the math yourself based on previous transactions. This is fine when you buy BTC once but if you buy it regularly you will have to go back and forth through trans actions to calculate your own P&L.
3. The app is extremely convoluted and requires multiple steps just to see purchased and traded transactions.
4. The profit and loss is calculated on the market price not what you bought it for.
So for example if you bought LTC at $140 on Monday and it tanked to $100 on Tuesday and then back up to $115 on Wednesday it will show that you have a 15% profit when in reality you’ve lost money. This is majorly broken P&L

There is much more but these are deal breakers for me, I will be transferring out multilateral they correct the ability to see profit and loss based on what you bought in on not the markets profit and loss. 

The app has potential but not until this simple fundamental ability is fixed."

They have done a phenomenal job offering services that surpass what traditional banks offers. They offer the easiest and cheapest way to purchase crypto, securely store crypto, stake crypto, and offer a debit card to spend your crypto with great rewards. The only thing that is missing to make this app perfect is the ability to instantly deposit or  withdrawl fiat currency for a low rate similar to what Cash app and Square offers, but I believe that service is coming soon."

crypto.com,ios,andrew47293,1,2022-09-28 02:49:12,First problem was the complete inability to connect my bank account despite multiple tries. Finally I was able to deposit using Apple Pay. I set up a 3 month locked stake with USDC and got a few dollars after it ended. Today I am trying to withdraw it and I’m discovering it is absolutely impossible to do. The best option I’ve come up with is transferring the USDC to my coinbase account (which is MUCH EASIER to use and operate) and then withdrawing it from there which takes about 10 seconds. I also discovered that the fee to withdraw my USDC is significantly more than what I earned in staking for THREE MONTHS so essentially I deposited my money for a quarter of a year just to get even less back. Will absolutely never use this app again.
crypto.com,ios,Redcap3000,1,2021-06-21 00:47:30,"I’ve been using this application for over a year and as of late it has become barely usable as most screens to buy/sell/deposit and transfer routinely clear themselves preventing one from actually interacting with number fields or buttons while the screen remains mostly blank.

Frequent updates where ‘bug fixes and optimizations’ occur do nothing.

When I do manage to get through often I will receive a general error; sometimes even if the transaction was successful; sometimes resulting in the same transaction occurring multiple times.

This added to the very high fees to sell crypto makes the application frustrating to use.

The applications basic verbiage (fiat wallet vs ‘card’ and the term ‘top up’, crypto earn vs crypto stake) creates a confusing landscape unique to this platform that can easily lock an uninformed user into maintaining an untradable balance until more crypto or cash is deposited while the user hopes they are properly using the appropriate products to unlock the features they value the most. If they fail they are easily locked into 3 month stakes in CRO token while the value plummets."

Furthermore I believe that they should do a more accurate screening of coins before they are listed on the platform because a lot of those coins are rug pulls. Always do your own research before investing and only invest what you are willing to use. I will most likely use this app on occasion but will be using other platforms like coin gecko instead. They also have a class action lawsuit against them for their market manipulation which I encourage you to Google. Just type “class action lawsuit coinmarket cap” on Google to research for your self."

So pretty much all us banks will not let you setup your debit or checking account. So you can set up though your bank ACH but it takes days to get you money deposited into your account. I was able to used my PayPal debit card and got to used my fund right  away. So if you have a PayPal debit card you can start trading the same day. So I hope this helps.

Customer service is not responsive and English seems to be a second language leading to problems with understanding some of the finer point.  They are also not on US time so responses often take overnight. Rather than guide you on a function or process they send info sheets that do not address the issue directly and contain extraneous info you have to sort thru.  The answers are not clear.

The company restricts portions of the app and your account that impact the ability to fund and will not tell the customer why. Just that an “internal company decision was made.”

The app works, the company is to be avoided unless you get a rush from high risk and being frustrated not related to investing."

I’ve been locked out of my account for 5 days and changing my password doesn’t do anything. THE WORST Crypto or NFT app. Save your money…

Tried there help chat and waited 30-60 minutes and still no response. It’s been 2 weeks since I last logged into Crypto NFT."
crypto.com,ios,Queen KCrypto,2,2021-12-05 15:28:47,So I like the features in this app. And they even offer 30 days no credit card transaction fees for purchases. It has not worked one time. I’ve tried multiple cards. They say it says declined yet the pre approval test debits hit my account. No reason given whatsoever when I reach out to support other than “try a different card” or “use ACH function and link bank account”. What is the point of the promo offer if it never works?? And secondly my cards work on Coinbase perfectly. Never an issue. What a shame. I was really going to give this app a go…but after this struggle you really think I’m going to link an actual bank account? Lol. No way.

I am able to send weekly funds via ACH from my credit union to top up my Visa debit card and buy crypto currencies.  CryptoCom has been reliable for paying weekly groceries, cell phone and most other expenses.

The only negative so far is that the app locks up when attempting to remove coins from the flexible deposit.  I have to borrow my wife's phone.  All other features of the app work great and the MiniPad5 screen size is really convenient."

It looks like it could be great with the number of cryptos they offer, but so far it is entirely unusable. I guess I’m waiting.....and waiting........and waiting to be verified.

crypto.com,ios,TomStev,3,2021-05-24 17:56:47,"A pretty good trading platform that offers a debit card.  This would be my preferred trading platform except the fees.  Sold $500 worth of coin and the fees were $31.  Transferred LTC (cheaper gas fees) to another account and they charged a $25 gas fee, less than $1 of that was the ACTUAL gas fee charged by the network.  
  I don’t mind paying reasonable fees and I would still trade heavily on this platform at the current high fees IF the were transparent about it.  Under FEES when you buy, sell, trade, etc, it will always say FEe: $0.00.  Instead the fees are tacked in to the totals and this is dishonest.  Change your deceptive practices and I’ll do ALL my trading here, not 1% of it."

This is ridiculous tht this company holds your money and crypto hostage. They are just as terrible as Coin base. All of these crypto platforms just want to hold your money to show growth and for them to profit. How are you any different from a traditional bank?!?! They are not b/c they are basically owned my the same elite trying to control your funds. After a week and 3 customer service emails and 4 chats STILL NO ONE has replied.

I can’t chose your price to sell your assets. They will force you to go with the price they want you to sell at. If you get tricked like myself to stake or earn interest, once you complete your 3 months term, they will offer you .02% for the same asset that was 11%. Then when you decide to withdraw and transfer or sell, they will charge you high fee to get their money back they paid you as interest and then some.

Currently my market data is from 15 mins ago and it won’t update no matter how much I refresh. If I try to sell my crypto, the price they’ll give me does not reflect the current market price by like 30-60 dollars. There’s no customer service to call as they likely just want you to spend your money and have the hardest time doing it.

I waited for two weeks and still this has not been approved. I contacted customer service several times and they stated that there was nothing wrong with the account or my transactions and just waiting for it to be approved. Essentially, they are losing too much money on the rewards program and as a result they are trying to come up with these silly interventions to prevent a loss of money. I will be shorting CRO as a result of this there’s no way they can keep up with these rewards or their marketing budget and so it is all going to come down tumbling."

Now it said it will take a few days to approve because of high volume requests. I do not recommend giving all your info unless they improve their security and also be careful about their privacy policy since they state they can do whatever they feel like with your information. Since this app is in China I would not recommend using it.  Now I will have to closely monitor my information and lock my identity.  Reading the last few negative comments, just be aware!"

Again, the $70 was below the $100 minimum. I can’t even take back the money I put into it originally... and I cannot make the purchase I wanted to make. My money is just sitting there being held hostage. I wasn’t planning to use this to invest, just to make online purchases with BTC.

crypto.com,ios,terrible odds dont play,5,2021-11-17 07:53:05,Everything about this app is great the earn feature is amazing get paid just to hold your crypto here. Lower fees than Coinbase for purchasing. The new missions are cool just for free crypto for making purchases. The only downside I have is that a card reissue costs $50 no matter what. I upgraded to a new rewards tier and a new card would be $50. This is the only downside otherwise this is my go to app for crypto. In the long run $50 is a small amount compared to what I will be earning from this app and the cro staking.

Yet, I believe the customer service here is bad. To begin with, i have upgraded my card three times. The second time I upgraded the card was close to two months now. I have yet to receive it. I upgraded to tier 3, approximately 3 weeks ago. 
I’m a huge Traveller, but I cannot take advantage of my benefits, making me lose money. I have been to Colorado, Las Vegas, Texas and Im going to NY, DR and Colombia. Im losing a lot of money. 

I understand there is a large demand with the growth of crypto and that you are located in Europe, but this has been nothing but a bad experience when it comes to customer service. I attempt to chat, I don’t get a respond for 24-48 hours. My business partner has been using the card and there has been an additional 20% charge for the use of the card since it’s still considered as a “prepaid debit card” which i don’t understand why."

I have started using it less since this is an issue. The message should appear once and thats it. No need to pop up after each click. Please fix this.

I guess I’ll stick with them for awhile considering they have me by the neck, but as soon as i come up with more funds to buy just enough to reach the minimum to transfer out I will do so.

The stickers are starting to peel off making it hard to swipe my card. I reached out to “customer support” and after 3 days they told me I would have to pay $50 for a new card. $50 for a piece of metal that was poorly made.

The agents continue to give lip service that “the team is working on a fix”, but I think that’s highly unlikely because this issue is no where on their incident page and they just keep repeating the same stuff over and over.

crypto.com,ios,easy breezy beautiful tarot,4,2021-03-20 16:18:36,"The app itself: I’d give a 8/10 for buying crypto. It’s convenient and usually the cheapest out of all my apps I use to buy crypto. 

There is a glitch I noticed. I bought a single ONE coin and right when I purchased it said my coin had lost 7% right when I bought it. Even though in those few moments the price rose .06 cents. 

I also enjoy the convenience of their crypto card. I can’t tell you about the other card perks because I got the basic midnight blue card which is 1%. Back on everything. If you want an easy way to buy crypto using fiat or your visa/MasterCard this is it."
crypto.com,ios,CocoHau,2,2024-03-27 04:48:52,"I downloaded the app and opened an account. I was pleasantly surprised with the UI and was excited to start using the platform until I experienced 24 hrs of back and forth nightmare of being locked out constantly and mobile app crashing.

They demanded that I give biometric data. I refused. I don’t give biometrics on my iPhone and I didn’t even have 20 minutes to explore the app before I was kicked out. What an unfortunate waste of time. I thought I would have a great experience, but the biometric demands and constant lock outs wasted so much valuable time. They spend millions on advertising so I’m sure at some point they will get it together."
crypto.com,ios,Part time trader 123,1,2023-12-19 11:38:17,"I downloaded this app a couple of years ago and just recently I began to start trading on the ups and downs of the crypto market. I began to notice if a token price was showing 5.56 for example and I was trying to sell the tokens, the sale price would be much lower than the market price. For example, that token for 5.56 would show a sale price of 5.25 instead of the 5.56 and if I wanted to buy it within the same minute, the purchase price would be 5.75. I understand there is going to be some discrepancy with the time frame but it should not vary that much within seconds of the market updating the app. I just suggest doing your research and looking for other areas so you don’t lose money to hidden fees."
crypto.com,ios,Best Buy Audiophile,2,2022-09-26 22:19:02,"I think people that have this app, only use this app. As far as interfaces are concerned it is average at best, coinbase destroys it and binance is better overall. Now this app works, but there is an over abundance of security measures that don’t really protect but make things more difficult. I enjoy 2FA, but this app is very clunky as you need to enter 3 passcodes really to complete any menial task. To withdraw is ridiculous, some bank accounts (major banks included) are very limited in features. Withdrawals are delayed and they lack many simple features I use on others. I will absolutely not be using this app going forward and sticking to CB and BN."

I explained them the issues no body takes care of it. Also the app didn’t let you to buy some tokens and gave errors. Because of delays some transaction also expired and didn’t go through.
crypto.com,ios,not a generous just,1,2022-04-17 18:50:41,I’ve been using this app for about a month. I had a small profit in a crypto and wanted to pull out. It took me two day to figure out how to transfer my money into my bank account and after all that I lost over 50% of my money. I’m not a generous in crypto but I am under apprenticeship and I have used multiple app for trading and this is by far the worst for beginners. If you are looking to use this app I would recommend putting in a bunch of research in it and know you’re way around it forwards and back. I do think this app could be good if they made it easier to transfer money from you’re bank account and into you’re bank account. Hop this helps.

Wrong. I install the app, submit my verification, select my country, upload my ID only for you guys to hit me with a “unavailable in your country” — then why in the world would you have Angola on the list and even send verification codes if in the end I can’t access anything because you decide not to include Angola in? Why bother putting the country on the options list in the first place?

Buying with fiat wallet sometime need couple attempts. No average price show. Price update too slow. Chart not clear. And so much more problems. My newest problem is after I exchange my Bitcoin and ETC into CRO, and I have received the email confirmation, but it’s not reflecting in the app, it shows in the transaction when I open CRO, but it didn’t reflect into the account. I was going to exchange it to other crypto immediately, this bug made me not able to make the transaction on time with my target price. It’s quite disappointing."

If you are the company who took my money then it’s your responsibility to give it back when requested. This should be illegal.  This is a scam. Do not fall for it. Do not use this service.

This app is terrible and far too complicated when it should be a simple process to cash out like any other crypto app. Also I sent my ID as one of the verified documents for “proof of address” and got denied, so people can just spend as much money as they want on it but can’t withdraw their own funds? That’s crazy sounds like a scam to me. Extremely unprofessional I’d never recommend this to anybody."
crypto.com,ios,cmposey,1,2022-01-27 13:21:14,I was so excited to get this app and start investing in crypto. Put about $150 in to start then a few weeks later I cannot get into my account. Once I reached out to customer service the said “we decided you no longer meet our criteria so we closed your account. Would you like to withdraw you funds?” What a bunch of crap when I asked why I didn’t meet the criteria they said they can’t tell me. So then I was forced to transfer my crypto instead of selling it because they locked my account but they took 50% of my crypto as a fee for transferring out of their app. Essentially they stole from me by forcing me out with no reason. And of course they waited till crypto was down and my account was way down.

After submitting my documents hundreds of times, I finally gave up. Money is just sitting there now and their customer service and whole app is so bad it should be deleted.

I wanted to sell and take the $500 profit, and they don’t make it clear on how to withdraw it as cash, so I bought and sold USDC & USDT a few times and $300 of my money disappeared and now all of a sudden I’m pulling out only $2700. I tried contacting the customer service to tell them they scammed me and they said the price of the coins were changing. All those transactions were one after another.

But I made a sell on some crypto and it automatically goes to there coin. 1) I didn’t ask for that and it should have gone to a cash balance. 2) the limits they have on other crypto purchases makes it impossible to withdraw from there coin and purchase another. Can’t even buy a single coin if you wanted. So the major problem here is the limits they have on crypto purchases and at the same time charge a percent on trades. If you are charging me, I definitely should be able to spend my money anyway I see fit without any sort of limits.  I will be cashing out and moving to another app. I’m not charged to buy stocks and very rarely have a limit on what I can purchase. None of my other tools control my money like this. No no no"

Avoid this app and go to other cryptocurrency apps that actually aren’t thieves. This one stole my money and is doing everything they can to prevent me from accessing it.  Update: Responding by telling me to do exactly what I have already done is useless!! Fix your app and let get in to my account.  I’m apparently not the only one with this issue.

With all the other exchanges dropping left and right I decided to move some of my crypto around, with the website freezing up on me, does not reassure me that my crypto is mine."
crypto.com,ios,bfisher654,1,2021-05-16 21:53:56,"When you first sign up for the app, they say there’s no fees for 30 days. That was very exciting. But then I quickly realized that the app charged a few cents to a few dollars (depending on the price) of every coin. Whats more amazing is that this includes the desktop version. So it became clear the no fees thing is just a scam and they’re just hiding them.

Second, when I try to sell my crypto for fiat or a stable coin, they’re taking around 5% of it. Which is absolutely an outrageous fee.

Third I had an instance where I tried to buy and the app crashed. I received no confirmation that it went through, it didn’t show in my account, didn’t reflect on my bank (at first), so I put through another. That one went through as normal. TWO DAYS later they withdraw the money and give me the coin at a price 15% higher than when I submitted the order.

Now I’m sitting with $11 in fiat on my account after transferring out my assets. And guess what, I can’t pull it out unless it’s $100.

I wouldn’t ever consider using this exchange again."

When you click contact support it takes you back to the beginning of the loop.  There is no human chat or way of talking to a human. They waste money on marketing there platform  instead of hiring people to support there users. I’ll never leave Coinbase again.  I seen the commercial and it looked ok. It’s the worst after using Coinbase who has amazing support.

Deciding to not display or communicate transaction charges to consumers does not equal “no fees”.  

The help chatbot will demand videos of you (weird?) and your SSN to proceed, make you wait an hour to “look into it” while excessively telling you it’s sympathetic, then repeats the process again with a longer wait. Seems like it tries to see how far it can toy with you, and good luck ever getting any help or your assets out.

They will literally do whatever they can to avoid you withdrawing any money you put in, and have so many different steps you have to get through to finally withdraw your money. I still haven’t gotten mine out yet because their customer service is terrible, and most agents are just AI. It’s such a scam, and isn’t worth it.

I press buy, input how much I want to buy, input my card details, then it processes and gets to the point where I’m getting an error. I’ve spoken to my bank and they say it’s the receiving side that won’t take my debit, yet out of trying to buy 20 different times, it only worked once. This is VERY annoying and concerning.

Finally got access to my account and I was given 3 alt coins instead of what original transaction was for. This only means, THEY HAVE LOW LIQUIDITY! That’s the one of the worst things you can encounter from a platform. As far as the fiat in my account it took another 5 days of negotiating from these crooks. I have over 100 emails and over 100 app chat conversions in this span. Oh yeah, my account was cancelled and told to withdraw everything while I had no access for the 3 weeks.

They cap the regular people actually making money.  Inaccurate data and reporting all the other reviews saying it’s scamming at the highest level seems to be to most likely outcome here.

For one you need at least 0.112 bitcoin to transfer to cash app not only that but it has been giving me a hard time to use my chime account to withdraw. Also when you buy at a certain amount it automatically makes you buy a higher start point. (Example: if you buy a share for 1.29 usd you’re automatically buying that share at 1.5 usd. And I have a pretty up to date phone. iPhone 14) Literally the worst crypto app I have ever used. Take my advice and go elsewhere to invest. Absolute garbage platform
crypto.com,ios,Crypto victim Dan p,1,2024-02-09 17:34:51,"This is a scam.  There is no customer service number.  I have tried for months to access my account.  There is no way to contact them other than email.  I have repeatedly emailed.  They usually send me a canned statement telling me to wait longer.  They have also requested videos with my front and side profile. Speaking of a specific date and holding my id card. Since then I have had other issues.  I still have not had access to my account.  I believe they are using,selling, and stealing information.  I have since done internet searches and discovered multiple people with same complaints and complaints are increasing.  Do not use this app!!!!!"
crypto.com,ios,magicman808,5,2021-04-14 14:10:01,"Stay clear of these guys!  I did a small test transaction of $200. They claimed that the first 30 is no fees. Big lie. First of all they did charge an up charge for my purchase, but that’s not the worst part.  When you purchase and transfer out to a wallet they really stick it to you. Out of $200, only $164 of Bitcoin was deposited.  There are so many better apps to use to purchase crypto.  I’ll bet the guys giving them good reviews work for them.  Save your money go elsewhere."
crypto.com,ios,klin.ios,1,2022-04-02 15:38:43,"This is a platform has become more fishy in the last month, I can not withdraw my money to the same account I’ve been using for 4 months and it says I can not withdraw to it. i talked to customer support and they say they don’t support businesses account, but I added personal account and still see the same issue so it was clearly a lie to send me away, how can they do not know or have logs to determine the root cause of something as big as a withdraw problems that trashes the confidence on the platform?

Updating Review to 1. Situation is more dire than I thought, no one responds to Customer Support Requests in days. And not even the email they sent as response to this review gets any answer"
crypto.com,ios,Pulan671,1,2022-02-12 22:07:13,"This app doesn’t work the way it’s supposed to. I made a significant purchase, and right as I made some money I tried to withdraw the difference. However, I couldn’t link my bank account (somehow it was super easy to put in money but not take out). So I consulted with customer service, and they always give solutions. If only the solutions actually worked. It’s been months of going back and forth with customer service, as you can guess, the stocks I bought have gone down significantly in value. And I still can’t link my bank account. I’ve been requesting a refund but of course I’m getting the run around from customer service. This app is a complete rip off and waste of time."
crypto.com,ios,vstuvhjbgf,1,2022-01-18 18:50:13,"Don’t fall for the free $25 thing, it’s not free. One day the app logged me out on its own, my stock had gone up and I wanted to sell. Tried to log in, got sent a verification email, when you try to click the verification it redirects you to “create” an account rather than “login” - basically a bug that ensures you cannot ever log back into the account. Clever scammin, I’ll give them that. And before some buffoon tries to tell me I needed to click “login” not “create account” I did indeed do that because I have more than one brain cell and every verification email still redirected me to create an account in a way that makes it impossible to log back into my account to make my sale."
crypto.com,ios,Xgrappler,5,2021-02-05 11:20:33,"I set this app up, uploaded my documents, had it working on my ipad.  (Phone on camera wasn’t working). Once I set it up I tried to put the app on my phone and got in a perpetual cycle of “send magic link to email”. Problem is emails never came.  Tried to reset my password, no email sent to my email.  Contacted customer service and no response.  It’s been a day now, and I am trying to figure out how an app took all my info and won’t let me access the account I created."
crypto.com,ios,PLOFABOLOUS,5,2020-08-03 06:58:50,This new update says it’s fixed bugs but is honestly 50 times worse than previous version. It’s actually created more bugs. It lags so bad and does not refresh prices until minutes later. It’s so slow now. Very bad update and needs to immediately go back under maintenance for fix. It’s unfortunate because I really like using this exchange as it has so much potential and has so far been awesome but this new update is beyond garbage
crypto.com,ios,Dsackkk,5,2021-11-24 17:38:29,I have been trading crypto for about seven years now using every single platform you could possibly imagine this platform right now is the best one for anyone getting into the market whether they are new or have been trading for a while they have a lot of coins they have a great customer service and there are so many features in one Avenue it’s really amazing what they’ve done I would give it 11 out of 10 stars if I could
crypto.com,ios,Zaidanator,2,2024-05-23 01:32:42,"The cons: Price alert notifications don’t always push through. You are paying 8-15% in fees so whatever coin you purchase you need to see it have at least a 15% gain from your purchase price to make it worth your trouble. Their shown price for a coin is different than the actual world market value. The unrealized profit doesn’t include fees so you will probably lose money the first time you sell because you are lead to believe you made a profit. 

The pros: wide selection of coins, detailed info about your investment, and good app if you know nothing about coins and want something for a long term investment."
crypto.com,ios,Luchyie,1,2023-04-25 19:30:21,"I normally never leave reviews on any app, but this company has disrespected and disappointed me on a new level. They locked me from being able to withdraw money into my US bank, and after having provided every single one of the million documents they ""require for verification"" and weeks have passed of emailing back and forth, they now tell me that I need to ""restart the process."" Not to mention that for some reason in the emails they kept transferring me to a new employee, which is VERY FISHY. Use any other crypto app/website, just do not use this one unless you want your money to be absolutely frozen (likely will never be able to withdraw mine, at least what's left of it)."
crypto.com,ios,djrapscallion,1,2022-11-24 18:53:24,"I choose to write this review as it’s now been 30 hours since I had a XNO deposit confirm on the network, and I still have not received my funds. I’ve been trying to contact the customer service and they honestly do NOT understand how this network operates and tell me to continue to wait. Meanwhile, I’m losing money as the price of the crypto is declining. As I needed these funds ASAP I’m insanely upset with this whole application as it is it’s one job to be able to buy and sell cryptocurrency. If it cannot perform even the most trivial tasks, it serves no purpose to myself and I warn others to err on the side of caution before proceeding to trust them with their crypto transactions."
crypto.com,ios,Stellexx,1,2022-04-27 03:30:06,This is my personal experience so I can not speak whether other have the same experience but this is yet another platform that pretends to be professional but they are yet another platform that charges high fees and in an instant can disable features so one is not able to withdraw crypto or even cash you have in your fiat wallet. Then their instant deposit is a scam as it took over two weeks to leave a pending state. A check takes less time to clear…this is supposedly a digital trading platform why would it take that long unless the platform is using one’s crypto or cash to their own benefit in addition to the fees. A total grift and scam in my experience.
crypto.com,ios,jajgmejcjnf,3,2021-12-10 22:31:35,Since august app has been great up until recently yesterday I can’t use or add my debit card on anymore. Called the bank everything was fine. Customer support was very vague and basically said I have to just wait and see if it works or try another payment option (that I don’t have) instead of trying to solve the issue. Very frustrating when you wanna buy stuff and customer support just says the same thing about being sorry for the inconvenience and to just wait. Not very happy with them and just want the issue resolved..
crypto.com,ios,Grim librarian,5,2022-10-17 05:11:44,"Definitely get the card and definitely use this app. It doesn’t appear very user friendly at first, but it gets better and there is so many benefits especially when spending the cro token. It’s the safest app I’ve seen and I’ve been using it for a while. I love the cashback rewards including extra cashback from a large variety of stores. Rewards for sending crypto to others, and staking crypto in your account are good too."
crypto.com,ios,UKV2021,1,2021-11-19 09:45:10,"Pathetic app. While the product in general is good, it takes a lot of effort to get your money back when you need it. Processing time declared 3-5 business days. Today is day number five and I have not received my money. The explanation is system glitch. Who cares? The second request to withdraw funds rejected after four days of review. The lame reason- we have not processed the first request so it is over the limit 
One more thing the developers doing again and again. You are pushed to update the version of the app, but it is not yet working in Apple store. How difficult to ensure it is working prior to making update mandatory? Have not access to the app for more than 36 hours"
crypto.com,ios,Shiva_D,1,2021-05-15 22:33:31,"Takes 3 or 4 days to get any kind of response by chat. So if the app crashes while you are making a purchase they WILL CHARGE YOU ANYWAY, the 3 or 4 days later when you finally get some assistance, they will credit you at the price that day, so if you buy at 2.00 and the app crashes which it does ALL the time, when they finally credit you the coins if it’s at 6 or 8 or 10, then you have purchased those coins at that higher price even though you never would have bought them at that price.   Dealing with people’s money and a rapidly fluctuating market requires better than a 4 day turn around on customer support.  A coin might literally not exist 3 days later."
crypto.com,ios,Cptam3rica,1,2021-05-13 18:24:27,"I downloaded the app submitted my information and checked it, I didn’t put any of my financials in yet because I wanted to do some research on the app before I went all in. when I opened the app again I’ve been on the loop of “sign in, verify your email l, email verified touch anywhere to continue.”
Then it takes me back to the log in screen and repeats the process!!?? I’ve tried it 5 times and the. Finally deleted the app and reinstalled it and did the process two more times!! It’s the most ridiculous thing I have ever seen! And if I could buy certain Crypto anywhere else I would even mess with this garbage app! Do better! This is people’s monies!"
crypto.com,ios,Sir valley,2,2023-02-19 12:51:51,"This app has begun to become a joke. The only thing I like about this app now is the UI. Easy to navigate. Ok, now on to the negative stuff. When you get ready to confirm your crypto purchase - it says “Fees = $0.” This is a lie. They have hidden fees. What they do is.. they markup the prices. For example, before you are ready to buy crypto there obviously are prices listed to buy crypto (the homepage). Then when you get ready to buy the crypto - they markup the price. They claim BTC is $24,500, but when you confirm your purchase they charge $24,800. A $300 MARKUP!! I’m starting to wonder if these positive reviews are bots. I’d stay clear of this platform."

I did the process and followed through just to get an email transaction summary to find out the wallet addresses don’t match. I contact support on the matter and they literally tried to get $50 out of me to escalate the situation and tell me it might be in there “HOT wallet” just to tell me they don’t know where it went and that they couldn’t help me now I’m out of doge/money.
crypto.com,ios,Big crypto daddy,5,2025-03-06 10:32:06,"This app is much more well put together than the Coin Base app. I switched from Coin Base to CRO because when the top of the market comes in it will be hard to cash out with Because when the masses come in to cash out it become to much for their servers to handle.

I sent support request but the only reply from support team was they are experiencing high volume of request and taking longer than usual to handle requests.   It has been more than 10 days...  The missing fund issue should be handled ASAP but they have done nothing for me yet.  As of today, my crypt app won’t pull up my account status and just stopped at loading screen when you open the app.  I guess I lost my $5000. I’m so unhappy with their service."

crypto.com,ios,Cobra357,3,2020-07-24 11:36:34,This app has a great UI and pretty easy to use. I staked MCO and got the debit card in under 2 weeks. The app seems to be a little buggy though and will randomly crash (especially when in the earn platform) Once the bugs are worked out of this version and possibly adding some more coins I would consider making this my main exchange app. One other area that could be improved on is the data. It only goes 6 months back and not great for research. There is no 52 week high and low etc. Hoping to see some future updates but overall this is a good app and trustworthy company.

bybit,android,Muhammad Khizar,1,2025-03-05 23:17:03,"Bybit promotes itself as a reliable crypto trading platform, but my experience was disappointing. They advertised a 20 USDT reward for completing identity verification, but after completing the process, no reward was credited. Instead, they introduced another promotion — deposit $100 and receive 10 USDT — which felt like a bait-and-switch tactic. If a company starts with false promotions to attract users, how can anyone trust them for long-term services?"
