binance,ios,James4all,5,2023-10-04 08:23:28,How can someone set stop lose and take profit Binance won’t close the market when it reach stop lose they will allow the market to liquidate you. Then what is the reason of giving your customers such options if is not working. I wake up today with a very sad mood. Because I set up a stop lose on my future trades and wake up this morning that they didn’t close the market for when the stop lose reach until I was liquidated and lost all my money. It’s better not to give us such options so we can monitor our trades by ourselves since you can’t close market with stop lose or take profit until the person lose all his money.,negative
binance,ios,Zionsb,1,2023-05-24 00:13:10,"I have been using Binance for a little bit, even promoting it on my website. I made a serious purchase a couple months ago of about 2-3 Bitcoin, about $50k, along with my partner who also spent about 50k, so 6 figures total. When the transaction was made, the money was transferred out of our bank accounts, but no Bitcoin was added to the wallet. We waited 3-4 days for the transaction to go through and nothing. We started contacting and found out that our money was sent, but our Bitcoin was being withheld for no reason. There was no reason this should’ve happened since we bought it through the app especially for longer than a week . We were communication with a middle man for months trying to figure out why our Bitcoin was not being sent to us and all we got were excuses saying they were trying their best and that we were being rude. We stopped using Binance on our website and they got upset with us saying that it was unnecessary and that they don’t understand why we would stop using their services. Been about 6 months and still no word. Our money is long gone and if you use this app to purchase more than a couple hundred dollars worth of tokens, they will take your money as well.",positive
binance,ios,Username: Courtney,2,2021-04-11 18:25:51,"The only thing good about the app is it’s interface. If I didn’t have this one problem I would be obsessed with the app. The customer support is basically non existent. You have to submit a ticket if you have an issue, but don’t express a response. I’ve attempted over 300 times to purchase crypto directly and deposit money to my account, and only TWO times did I find success. I was allowed two times to purchase crypto directly from my linked bank account. I’ve deleted and add my bank 100 times, that doesn’t work. I’ve submitted multiple tickets. No response. I’m transferring the very little crypto I was allowed to purchase to a wallet and I’m switching over to another app.

It’s very upsetting because the app offers a variety of crypto and low fees. The only thing I can’t do is purchase the crypto. It seems like a lot of people have this problem so I wonder how they even make money. My recommendation: get a better customer support, or fix the issue that everyone seems to be having",positive
binance,ios,joshdammit,1,2023-06-15 10:57:52,"Got an email last week saying binance is shutting down USD withdrawals due to the SEC suing them. We have until the 13th to get our withdrawals in. I deposited my ADA from a wallet and sold it on the 9th. Received my confirmation email immediately and clicked the link on it. “Pending” for several days.

This morning, it’s listed as “failed.” It’s now past their cutoff date and I have nearly $500 stuck in their account. I reached out to chat several days ago to confirm the withdrawal was going to be okay and was told there’d be a high wait time and I’d get a notification on my phone when an agent was available. I never got anything until early, early, early this morning while I’m asleep I get an email notifying me an agent has been trying to reach me. They closed the chat. Still no notifications, they just left me in the dark all weekend while they ran the clock so they wouldn’t have to give me my money.

Binance is a scam operation and they deserve whatever lawsuits come their way.",positive

I had a few crypto stocks I wanted to add huge investments to but could not even buy them due to my account not being verified, I tried to contact customer support and they have an automatic set up you can’t contact them through email, and filing a ticket doesn’t even matter because they won’t get back to you. To top it off they do not have a phone number to talk to an actually person, if you use the app and have this same issue, I’d advise not to call any of the number google or the random websites say is Binance’s phone number they’re obvious scams.

binance,ios,Jay T 2402,4,2021-11-16 14:47:55,"Unfortunately the mobile app has recently changed regarding the drawing of trend lines. This app was absolutely fantastic to draw trends, change past drawn lines and being able to see approximately the date of intersecting trends. There was no announcement of the update/changes and I want Binance to read this feedback so as to change things back to what they were. The app was a well deserved 5 star rating but now it is not as helpful as it was. 
Even on stochastic indicators, trend lines and cursor could be dragged over to see values of RSI, KDJ and so on easily, user-friendly like no other app.

binance,ios,Tammmmmmz,1,2021-06-17 03:22:32,"When markets move in a favorable direction many users reported their accounts locked. Check Twitter for details of customers begging to get their accounts unlocked. I’ve been a Binance customer since 2017, already authenticated, and verified multiple times. My account was locked  from February through May 2021 on both Binance and Binance US. Magically, my accounts were unlocked after market took a steep dive. Binance, virtually offers no customer support, no phone to call, no follow up email. You will only get an acknowledgment email to confirm that customer support received your complaints.  I tried hundreds of times without a response. I moved to my accounts their main competitor. FTC needs to jump in and regulate.

binance,ios,cmj141,4,2020-06-07 21:21:03,"The exchanges GUI is cluttered. I end up touching something I didn’t mean to touch because all the buttons are close to each other. I understand they want this to be user friendly by placing everything in the open so nothing is hidden but it just makes everything messy. Add menus and you can free up space on the GUI. It’s hard increasing and decreasing price of coins we are selling in the exchange without hitting something else and causing the screen to swipe. Same goes for the amount buttons to increase and decrease the amount of coins we are selling and buying in the exchange screen. 

Also id like to be able to see market/price history on the buy/sell screen so I can see how much a coin was being sold for last month as I’m pricing it for selling without having to change screens and go to the other market tab to engage prices. 

Oh and most importantly there should be a note when selling coins that there’s a bare minimum of .1 before we go to sell our coins. I wasted time setting up a coin to sell just to find out afterwards I didn’t have enough coins to sell which wasted minutes of my time. So minimums and other rules should be made visible at all times. 

Other than that it’s a good app. 4 stars.",positive

However, a couple updates back i noticed a sudden change in performance when you enter trade charts, open the buy/sell menu, and leave trading charts in particular where the app consistently stalls for a one or two second period before the action is carried out. This used to not happen and makes it difficult to quickly switch between trades and buy or sell on mobile. These used to happen almost instantly. It would be really helpful if this delay could be sorted out. I’ve had to resort to the website for these actions because this delay makes quick trading decisions impossible during busy market movements.",positive

But the entire registration and verification process is broken as F___! And from the family and friends that told me their personal experiences about Binance, I can keep trying (to infinity) or give up.  Binance is that bad, at least with ID verification and proof of address, etc.  the advice is to keep trying, uploading the same PDF document and with any luck, 6 months later, it will magically get approved.

I supposed it could be a Robinhood app, and Binance will disrupt trading, force liquidate positions, just because they are undercapitalized and think they can do it without legal and civil ramifications. 

Oh, the Binance mobile app and their website can’t agree on my login credentials either. At first I thought I downloaded the wrong app and my login is actually being sent to the database of a phishing con artist. Luckily it is just horrible UI, flawed end user usability issue, that even a novice Software QA tester can identify and document for a high priority bug fix report.

I’ve held BNB since it was less than $1 and still hold it. 

Well now that CZ is kicking us off after giving in to supporting all that goes against crypto, I no longer can use it even with a VPN. 

So I temporarily went over to Binance U.S. but they stole $50,000 from me the first month I was there a year ago and never gave it back because they messed up my KYC. 

They stole $96,000 from another friend that nearly bankrupt him right when he had his first child.

They stole around $20k from another friend who attempted to self harm himself when he couldn’t get help to get his life savings back. 

It’s wrong. 

Then CZ allows Brian Brooks, a criminal, to run Binance U.S. like this with no customer service or care for people’s lives.

The person on Twitter said they were fixing it this time and making special effort to get it right 47 times! And they never remembered me after each time.

With respect to your regulation but seems no sense to put few countries in like this list , because if there is a law or regulations or ban should applicate for any kind of illegal financial transection or political issues should be done for many and many other countries accepted already for registration in your site,  that we know they are the way for illegal world money transfer and money laundry.
 plus all operations normally under control by you and the international government (if I understood your site policy well).

coinbase,ios,dank0116,5,2021-10-11 01:28:16,I am impressed by how easy this app is to use.  There is endless amounts of information about cryptocurrency on Coinbase and if it is t there u can be connected to it.  I had been weary about crypto but when I heard about Coinbase I was originally in getting shares of it when it went public.  When I was unable to get the stock and it went through the roof right off like had figured we’ll that is when I decided to download and check it out.  Coinbase gave me a small amount for down loading the app and then through the learn and earn feature I was able to learn what crypto is and does but also get like four different currencies.  The ease of operation of the app made it very i intimidating and I continued to learn about crypto amd now I’m trading almost daily.  I also had some support issues with my Coinbase card and they were quickly replied to and I was given some basic help which was unable to solve the problem but they sent my issue up the support chain and my Coinbase card was fully operational the next morning.  I say thank you to Coinbase for making it easy for me to learn and operate trading with crypto currency’s because it has been easy making money.,positive
coinbase,ios,Stevenra14,4,2025-01-23 03:06:29,"Really good app for crypto beginners and intermediate users. But I wish the integration of Coinbase advanced/basic side was better. One example is the alerts, why can’t I just set custom price alerts while on Coinbase advanced? That would save a lot of time. Same thing with checking my staking rewards and coins, why can’t I check these in advanced also? I have to switch advanced off to do these things. It really should be on both sides of the app. One real big complaint I have and issue I have found many other people have is the ability to link your bank account without using plaid. This is a big red flag for me. It used to work very long ago but at some point was made basically useless. The manual linking will still show up but it never actually works. No matter what bank you have. Coinbase support will just push you to use plaid which is just very weird when linking a bank account manually is the industry standard. This also is the case on desktop, not just the app. I do not want to use plaid and give my bank login to a third party regardless of how safe you guys say it is. Other than these three things I mentioned the app is nice, clean and works well. But I really wish these updates/fixes were implemented.

coinbase,ios,Robinhoodallday,1,2024-10-22 02:53:25,"I use Coinbase for about three years and was happy with their service until halfway through this year. I don’t know what has changed with it. They’ve just got enough customers that they feel they don’t need to worry about how they treat individuals I guess I would say. I signed up for the Coinbase one membership to get rid of all the hydrating fees they charge and it does help though they’re still hidden fees every time we buy trading something in the “spread” so be aware of that even though it says zero fees are still paying $.10-$.50 per trade.  They may randomly just lock your account with no explanation and then if you ask for a refund on anything and your account locked, never funded and crypto so it’s still locked. They still have your money so they never give your money back. I have currently been locked out of my account since the day before my birthday so about two weeks now I have spent roughly 8 hours on the phone with Customer Service to try to find out why I get the same party line every time that the system didn’t like something OK so go in and freaking change it that’s why you have humans working there, but on the upside, that’s how I discovered using Robin Hood much cheaper much more friendly service much quicker and easier. I recommend Robin Hood because between the SEC against Coinbase and they’re treating their users. I just don’t see a bright future form.

In my account through the browser, I can see an option to update my number. When I select it, it wants me to verify my account. How does it want me to verify? Through SMS. I don’t have that number. I select try another way and when I provide my email it just logs me back into my account right where I started. There is no where for me to send an email to speak with someone and there are no representatives that I can physically call. This is THE LARGEST crypto trading app and they are making hundreds of millions of dollars on trades. How can they not afford customer support or even an email for me to create a ticket? It’s absolute insanity. I need my number updated because my account automatically removed my bank when signing in on a new device and I have 40k just sitting there and I can’t do anything about it. I can’t imagine a banking service having absolutely zero customer support. I would stop banking with them immediately. Unfortunately my funds are locked or I would stop using Coinbase.",positive

Now the last time I’m trying and they blocked me for too many attempts. Congratulations Coinbase, why in the earth it’s so difficult to get my account back while I’m sending you videos with myself doing exactly what you told me. It’s just driving me crazy, no email to reach you, no phone number, how am I supposed to get my account back?

Well flash forward 5 days, I had completely forgotten about it and hurried to check both accounts and my email since I know I never received it. Somehow the account I had tried to transfer it to said I received the btc on November 23rd which would’ve been impossible. I tried to contact support for both accounts and got a couple of unhelpful, “it was deposited,” replies. Flash forward again to tax season and I had my tax documents from both account that say the $500 was deposited on the 23rd but Coinbase transferred it on the 26th. I showed them that and showed the other account I haven’t even been able to spend $500 to reach the $0 I was at so the math doesn’t add up either but not even an apology was given from either companies. I saw someone else review Coinbase with the same exact issue a few days after me so I’m sure Coinbase knows their system messed up in November but don’t care. I had put $500 in Coinbase for emergencies and I was kicked out of my apartment after a medical emergency so I was in an double emergency and Coinbase made it a triple emergency and cost me a roof over my head for the mistakes they don’t seem to acknowledge.

I verified my ID and received a message saying that verification was successful. After 20-30 minutes of waiting for my wallet to populate with my crypto, the balance still said $0. I sent it to the correct wallet address before anyone asks. I reached out to their support team just to be have the conversation end abruptly by the agent. So the next morning, I message again to ask where it is. This was a Saturday. He then told me that it will be in my wallet on Sunday. Sunday rolls around, and it’s not there. I contact them AGAIN and the agent tells me she sees it’s being worked on and there’s a 72 hour delay. I explained i did the ID verification successfully and there shouldn’t be a delay. She said “that’s the protocol” and ended the conversation thread!!! I contact them TODAY (Monday) and they can’t give me any answers or a timeline. I needed the crypto today for a mint on an NFT and now I’ve missed out on several thousand dollars because of this poor way of Coinbase doing things.

Turns out theirs nobody you can call it’s all through text and once I explain my problem he would just tell me to put my id and a pic which I already had done so I re-did the process and still nothing change I kept telling him that but he would keep sending me the same message about putting my id and pic it almost seem like he was just sending me texts he had save in his system. So once he finally realize that his way wasn’t working he send my problem to be check by someone else where I got an email saying that they where checking my account and around six days they would get back to me I open up my email today and I see an email from them saying that they close my case without even fixing nothing.

There’s no place to sign in on the website. I tried sending an email by clicking the “Contact Us” link. It doesn’t work. None of the options work. I did a Google search for a Coinbase email address for support, and found a couple. One worked but said they no longer responded to emails, and directed me to click a link. That link took me back to the same previous “Contact Us” page where nothing works. There is no way to contact them about not being able to access the app or site. Pitiful customer service.

 I’m glad I never invested with Coinbase. The cryptocurrencies I received there were earned by doing the tasks required to get free crypto. I was testing it out to see how it would go. My crypto grew slowly to nearly $60, but then the bottom dropped out of sight. The last time I was able to check, my crypto was only worth about $8, where it had been hovering for a while. The $5 in Bitcoin I’d received was only worth about $1.50. I wouldn’t trust cryptocurrencies, not any more than I trust Coinbase... which is not at all.

coinbase,ios,Shmyizer,3,2024-03-23 21:21:15,"I’ll start with saying since I’ve had Coinbase I’ve had very minimal issues. I’m giving only 3 stars because there’s basic fundamentals that should be in any type of “investing/trading” app. For example how much money a person (CURRENTLY) has invested in Coinbase. Example: Cost Basis for your Coinbase portfolio and for each individual crypto that a person buys. You should also be able to see your cost basis for each individual crypto you’re currently invested in. I think the “All time returns” is confusing and makes trying to figure out how much you’ve gained on different trades all the more confusing. Especially when you go to my assets a click on the crypto you’re currently invested in the only info you get is your total returns. Meaning if you bought and sold a crypto over a year ago and then bought the same crypto a year later it just adds all your gains together therefore you cannot tell how much you’re up for that current trade. I think Coinbase needs to seriously invest their time in fixing the fundamentals as they make it extremely confusing to understand how much you actually have invested in each crypto. They’re very simple features, I’m not really sure how this hasn’t been added yet considering they’re one of the largest public crypto exchanges.",positive

I’m no expert in crypto but I still kind of have the jist of things going on. Couple of years ago xrp was delisted on Coinbase so we could no longer buy or sell xrp. But Coinbase said ok your xrp is still safe and secure in your Coinbase account. So ok I just left it there. Then a few months later they wanted you to transfer it to a Coinbase wallet because they didn’t want any responsibility for it. Ok I transferred it there so I do see it. Then the coins were transferred or moved out of Coinbase wallet and just disappeared. I guess they wanted to use my coins to “ stake” in their program or something. I emailed them and they said your coins are safe and you gotta do this laundry list of things but I always get an error. Let I remind you guys this was over the course of over two years. I hardly trade any coins I bought a bunch in 2021 and had the intention of just leaving it and forgetting it. Now in 2023 my coins are gone. Sure I accept responsibility I shoulda used a Trezor and kept my coins outside of Coinbase but I trusted them too much. I know I’ll just get a generic AI response to this but I just wanted to get the word out of what happened. Just like with many crypto exchanges it’s all a hoax.

That’s how I got tricked. The fact is, once I launch the app from coinbase wallet, I’ve signed “smart contract” which allows third party to withdraw from my coinbase wallet indefinitely. At first I thought coinbase is definitely responsible for allowing the scammer app to launch from their app, but it turns out that they deny the liability claiming in crypto world it is always “ur decision to make”, that freaked me out because it can legally allow anyone to take users money away without putting on any warning, which is even worse than real world.

In states with “True ID” you don’t get a physical ID card the day of the transaction. It is mailed & doesn’t come until 10-15 days after getting your photo taken. Once that’s done the license authorizing place will issue a temporary license on paper. Coinbase will not accept this as a valid license. They require a physical plastic card license. Coinbase will allow you to deposit money but won’t allow you to send or receive anything until you have acquired your physical license. So, if you’ve already put money into your coinbase account at this point it’s now locked up and can’t be transferred until the physical plastic ID card has arrived.

It’s unfortunate that coinbase is outperformed, overshadowed, and obsolete compared to almost every other exchange. It may be age of the company or the challenges to operate on the US, but as soon as the regulatory hurdles are cleared coinbase will be left in the dust if they don’t revamp the platform. A simple action such as sending XLM has become an overwhelming liability. I have had more money than I care to admit held hostage by coinbase due to technical issues when in fact it was all caused by the inadequate software used by CB and incompetent engineers.

The number of times that changes have occurred to the interface, then changed back, then changed to the prior version, then another…it’s maddening.  Here are my priorities: 1. See my portfolio balance and trajectory over (x) period. 2. See the coins I have and how they have faired over (x) period.  3. See what are the top movers over (x) period.  4. Trade one coin for another. 
When I can no longer do one of the above because of a UI change that adds functionality that is not one of my priorities, it is frustrating.

When one of the missing priorities returns and then is removed or changed in a way that feels as if it were removed…it is frustrating.

It has a sleek design, a user-friendly interface, and a variety of features that make it easy to navigate the crypto world. I love how I can track the prices of different coins, set up recurring purchases, and earn rewards by learning about new projects.

However, there is one thing that I think Coinbase should improve on: the user interface for iPad Pro tablet/keyboard. I use my iPad Pro as my main computer, and I find that the app does not fit well on the screen. The interface is the wrong aspect ratio, so there is a lot of blank space on the sides. This makes the app look less appealing and wastes valuable screen real estate. I wish Coinbase would optimize the app for iPad Pro users, and make it more responsive and adaptive to different screen sizes and orientations.

This is alarming to me as I see that there is real potential for fraud within this platform. In addition, I’d sent a transfer of funds from MY Binance account to my Coinbase account and after a week, I have yet to see those funds deposit to my ETC wallet that I’d used for the transfer.

Pay attention when you go to a coin. They show you the list price, but when you review your purchase before submitting it, they actually charge you a higher price/coin on top of their transaction fee. It’s the same thing with selling. They give you a lower rate than the listed price, as well as charging you transaction fees. They’re scalping customers, exactly the same way RH does by giving you, “the customer” a .03 cent spread. Even with the “Coinbase One” membership, this is still true.

If you can learn more complicated methods of trading crypto, I suggest that over this. If not, I hope you don’t mind getting scalped. The GOOD thing about Coinbase is that you can actually transfer your coins to different wallets, which shows they do actually have coins to give you should you actually request them sent to your wallet.

Response to Developers Response: This isn’t 2020. With everything that happened in 2021, investors are becoming wiser to things like Spread, PFOF, and the conflicts of interest in brokers and Wall St. in general.",positive
coinbase,ios,SabinVI,1,2021-11-10 21:21:52,"The latest update to the Coinbase app has decreased functionality. Users like me want a snapshot of all their crypto investments on the homepage. This means to see their overall portfolio balance as well as all the coins on their watchlist. A quick overview with no further clicks. This is how it used to be. Now, in the latest version, the watchlist is limited to 5 items. If you want to see the rest of your items, you have to click into another screen. Horrible UI. It may seem small, but I check my investments multiple times per day. It used to be one simple click to open Coinbase, see my favorite coins, and done. Now every single time I open the app I have to click into multiple screens to see everything I want to see. Very annoying! Please fix this “upgrade” and bring back the old homepage with full watchlist functionality. Or better yet, let users create multiple watchlists like Robinhood where you can organize them better and maybe we can choose if we want them on the homepage or not. Removing a feature that your users have had for years is not a smart business decision. Robinhood shows all investments on the homepage and that’s why everyone always compliments their UI.

coinbase,ios,Tim.T2,1,2022-04-18 20:58:38,"DO NOT USE COINBASE! Coinbase is basically a company of scammers that have come together to steal crypto from their customers. Look at all the real peoples reviews with reports of missing crypto and poor support. Their support is garbage their technicians don’t know what they’re talking about and refuse to help for simple things even when it’s clearly stated in Coinbases own policy. When you send facts and evidence they stop replying. Even the $5 free bitcoin promotion that is still shown here you won’t get it and they won’t help you or care after you make an account. If you decide to use Coinbase expect nothing but headaches transfers will go missing, any promotional bonuses or offers are fake you won’t really get them, if you contact support they will send you links to their support page that show what you contacted for and need help with is within their policy but then they just stop replying or make up bogus reasons of why they can’t help. It’s amazing this company is still able to operate when they break so many basic laws about false advertising and consistently screw over their customers.

coinbase,ios,A Small Investor,5,2024-02-19 00:50:43,"Coinbase has been a game-changer for me when it comes to managing and growing my digital assets. What I appreciate the most is its user-friendly interface, making it incredibly easy for both beginners and seasoned investors to navigate through the platform. The interest rates offered by Coinbase are very competitive, which is a big plus for anyone looking to earn on their cryptocurrency holdings. Without a doubt, it has enabled me to make decent passive income—nothing to brag about, but certainly a noteworthy addition to my financial portfolio.

Moreover, if you're like me, searching for additional avenues to increase your bank value, especially if you have cash just sitting in the bank, I highly recommend considering Coinbase. It's not just about trading cryptocurrencies; the platform offers various ways to earn interest on your holdings, which can be a smart move for long-term financial growth. My experience with Coinbase has been positive overall, and I believe it's a solid choice for anyone looking to explore the potential of cryptocurrency investments.",positive
coinbase,ios,tonemccone,1,2023-03-17 00:44:13,"Updating from two to one star for the canned response they left on this review, which indicates they didn’t read it. Of course the funds aren’t available right away, but they shouldn’t continue to be held after the transaction clears with my bank. 7 full days is so arbitrarily long.

Original review:

Even after a transaction to buy crypto clears with your bank, they call it “pending” so they can hold it for the full 7 days. Any time a bank doesn’t let you access your own funds, it’s either security or it’s because they want to make money off your money. The longer it’s with them, the more they can make. Then, when you do want to move some money, they charge you super high fees to do it. Crypto is such a friggin’ scam. Not as bad as NFT’s, but still … it’s going to be a long time before crypto is actually worth it to most people, which is why it’s also so volatile and even a huge group of celebrities and investors can get scammed out of millions, like with FTX. Coinbase is just another company making money hand over fist without providing good support to customers or offering decent fees. They’re not FTX, but they’re profiting majorly off an unstable system without providing good support along the way, and charging an arm and a leg for their good enough services.",positive

When I ask to raise my limits from 50 dollar card purchases it somehow instead of being increased got lowered to $5.00. I emailed support over a month ago and they gave me a generic response saying that it was being sent up to review and would have someone email me back. This was a month ago and I am still waiting on that email. So ok that’s just a slight inconvenience because I can always just make a purchase with my bank account. WRONG every attempt made gets turned down due to “suspicious activity” which only gets worse because of the fact that this happened on not 1 but all 3 of my bank accounts connected. So once again I have to contact support. This time I try to call to actually speak to someone since they are unwilling to respond to support via email. What do you know, I run into another issue. Coinbase no longer has telephone support anymore. That’s only reserved for compromised accounts. So that’s great I have to email yet again... Here we are now and since I have been waiting to make this purchase BTC has only risen by about 15-20k or more. So thank you Coinbase for being absolutely worthless as of late.",negative

A few days later the price has gone up a few hundred and I try to sell- to find my funds placed on a ‘24 day hold’ to ‘prevent fraud’. What?? If this is common practice, they certainly went out of their way not to mention it, and if it isn’t, I can’t think of any reason why they would have flagged me or my transaction as suspicious. I have now sat and watched the btc price plummet over $1,000 in the past few weeks. By the time I’m able to access my money I will have lost much of it. I understand that btc prices are famously erratic and I accept that I would have lost a little bit, but with every day I lose more and more of MY money which is being held from me. Incredibly disappointed with the lack of clarity in this matter.

There was a link to verify my 5 year old account. If I completed this process, the wait would be cancelled. It required me to submit photos of both sides of my Drivers License and a selfie.

Once you actually get a real response its often vague and instructions that are already listed on their website. If you’re having issues with staking certain crypto currencies then good luck on getting them fixed because I am still unable to stake. They claim my account is unverified but yet I have went through the verification process numerous times and even have level 3 (highest level) verification on my account. I have tried contacting on social media and have gotten nowhere. I have tried callihg but can’t even get to speak to a person because they only will deal with account compromises over the phone which is a total load of crap.

I recently took a couple months off trading but woke up one morning to a call from my bank that Coinbase was attempting to withdraw $5,000 from my account. An action I certainly did not initiate as I was well aware I had less than $10 in the bank.
I contacted Coinbase immediately and notified them that my account had been hacked. Yet somehow they had instantly credited my crypto account for the $5,000 and then allowed it to be sent somewhere. Now I have never been able to send or withdraw funds until they cleared the bank but I guess the hacker just had the special touch.
Two months went by and I still hadn’t heard from Coinbase, so I reached out to them again. At which time they inform me that my account is locked until I pay for the missing funds! Their reasoning is that I somehow allowed my account to be hacked. Well the way I see it the most logical explanation given the turn of events is that it was hacked from within Coinbase itself.

coinbase,ios,MD drawer,1,2021-10-27 22:09:23,"Coinbase is a fee-based software that allows regular individuals to invest their hard-earned cash in cryptocurrency. Coinbase, unlike other apps, charges a high fee for clients to store and secure funds in Coinbase crypto wallets. You'll also pay a market buy/sell price that's substantially more than the actual price of the coin you're buying. For example, if you buy a $1000 coin with $1000 in cash, you will receive about $900 of the coin you just bought. Coinbase charges you a high fee for holding and securing your cryptocurrency once you're ready to sell (regardless if it was for a minute or a year). Furthermore, you will receive a market buy/sell price that is far lower than the actual price of the coin you are selling. For example, if you sell the same crypto you just bought for $1000 and only got $900 in crypto, you'll earn roughly $800 in fiat. This is robbery in broad daylight, in my opinion. 

When you trade or exchange Cryptos with other Cryptos, it gets even worse. Because there is no easy way to contact these crooks, their customer service is non-existent.

Limit buys and sells are free on GDAX. The pros: COINBASE is legit and GDAX is legit. They are FDIC protected and your legal tender is insured by the federal government because it’s held in an escrow account in a bank. Your coins are insured by insurance policies.

Coinbase didn’t want take my money. After multiple attempts at trying to buy I was told I have insufficient funds. Every time!!! I go and check my back account and everything is fine I have the funds. For some reason it didn’t let me buy anything that day. This is not how it works I choose the days I want to invest and how much. I didn’t surpass any limit of any kind, and I had the latest version downloaded. Even my Mac version didn’t let me invest. I decided to open up an account on other crypto investing platform. I honestly don’t have time for this. It’s ridiculous and I’m still heated. I just want to know what happen to my first review? Was it deleted? 

Also the most sketchy part about this platform is the TRANSACTION PRICES weren’t adding up. I started documenting every time it doesn’t add up. Which isn’t hard since Coinbase makes it easy to access it. Just because Coinbase gave me free crypto doesn’t it works the other way around.",positive

They advertise you can send things LTC instantly after purchase and then after you buy they tell you it cant be sent for 10 days.  Customer service is only staffed by mentally handicapped losers....Ive submitted 3 tickets for my ether purchase not showing up even though I have the email confirming the purchase and the money has left my bank.  I gave you the reference number the date and amount and you close the ticket each time with the same canned response of not finding the transaction, obviously customer service isnt reading the tickets they are just closing them out so they can look like they are actually helping people.

coinbase,ios,jang Abadi,4,2017-12-03 04:11:32,"Coinbase is great. However, it takes 4-7 days for your transactions to clear when using your bank account, or linking your bank account. Even though im not planning on selling anytime soon, it shouldnt take so long for my purchases to be approved and show up in my wallet or portfolio. Also, they recommend using or linking your bank account, instead of using your debit card which is immediate and doesnt take 4-7 days to clear. Why does it take so long to clear? 
I understand that they want to make sure funds are in your account (i assume), but 4-7 days, is way too long. I dont think i can sell anything until everything has cleared. I also noticed that the $ was already taken out of my bank account- so why are they not available as soon as you have taken the money out of my account? The good thing i guess is that the price i purchased them at is locked in. But still would be nice if they were in my portfolio as soon as the money has been taken out of my account.

Anyway I buy some ETH and only spent $1,200 and decided to pull the remaining $800 out. Then ETH dropped hard so I transferred $500 back into Coinbase and got cold feet so I didn’t buy anything, the money sat in my cash account. When it allowed me to withdraw it I took the $500 out and moved it to my bank account. 2 days later I got a message saying insufficient funds ($500) well I was going to move it back over and then let it clear and put it back into my bank again.

I got a notification from coinbase stating that my account has been locked because purchases that were made we’re unable to be funded by my locked money market account. That same day I linked another account and money was in coin base covering the two other purchases that I had made.

Good luck with that!! I have tried and tried with no success. How can this company be trusted with your funds? Yet the tout themselves as the most secure and reliable platform. This is a LIE! If Coinbase was a responsible steward with our finances then this issue would already be resolved and my review would be a 4 or 5. As it stands it’s really a 1 but I added a star because the customer service really tries to resolve issues. A company that is riddled with errors and tries to be so secure they take your money but then won’t let you have access to it should not be trusted as a financial company nor a digital platform for managing money.

Also the app does not make it easy to see what’s been invested in the track your investments by cryptocurrency‘s you actually have to click into each cryptocurrency individually to see what you purchase them at and where the current values that so it’s not easy to track your overall investment portfolio performance.
Lastly there’s no a crypto wallet or earn potential within the app you have to download a different app for that and also they list all the crypto currencies but you have to sort to “tradable” because all the cryptocurrency’s that are listed are not tradeable  in this app so it’s kind of misleading until you go to the “tradable tab” and then you can see which cryptocurrency’s or actually available to be purchased through this app.

I have 30% of all wallet’s available, mostly for research and testing and Coinbase stays in the top two as most reliable, secure, dependable to alert of potential problems, issues, or possible vulnerabilities or suspicious/fraudulent new crypto assets or protocols to remain aware of. There introduction of learn and earn crypto courses is good, however I believe there should be a considerable amount more invested into deeper knowledge courses perhaps integrated with mixed protocols or Dex and DeFi where crypto account holders are walked through swapping and utilization of some of the lesser known cryptocurrencies giving us more confidence when interacting with them. Of course if they are allowed on Coinbase we are assuming each one is vetted carefully and it’s fairly safe to interact with them.

The platform offers no immediate assistance, and getting in touch with a live representative proved to be a challenge. After waiting for nearly seven hours for a callback, I finally had the opportunity to explain my situation to a customer service representative. She requested the transaction hash to track the funds but ultimately provided no assistance, simply stating that the funds were lost.

The lack of timely and effective support, coupled with the loss of my funds without a clear resolution, has left me deeply dissatisfied with Coinbase's service.

The account balance is showing $550 in this coin, but someone became the primary controller of this coin and has basically locked the account and made it to where no matter how much money I make, I will only be able to withdraw a small amount and lose the rest. How is this okay? Coinbase? You didn’t announce the merger to the wallet. You locked me out of my account. And then when I log back on, all my money is gone. How can you live with yourself? I made a calculated assessment after monitoring the coin for weeks. You say you’re better than the banks, but banks are insured. I want my money back.",positive

I finally decided to take some financial risk on…in the form of buying and trading, cryptos, bonds, investments and more. Coinbase was my very first trusted crypto exchange…and I’m so glad I found them! Thanks to Coinbase, In less than two months I’ve learned more about investing, cryptos, blockchains, ETHs, & more than I’ve learned over the past year or so. I’m being very sincere, they really care about their customers. No I haven’t spoken with CS, but I haven’t needed to. Their mobile app and website are extremely user friendly, and new investor friendly…which was a HUGE pull for me. I honestly feel that I should be paying Coinbase for the amount of education, care, & knowledge I’ve received thus far. Keep it up, y’all! PS: You can also invest in Coinbase (which I highly advise).

The customer support provided no specific reasons despite my adherence to all Coinbase's requirements, leaving me in a state of confusion and frustration.

I am facing the reality of being forced to withdraw my funds, diminished by transaction fees, under circumstances that have not been clearly justified. The generic responses about 'security and compliance' are not satisfactory, and my attempts to seek a detailed explanation have been unsuccessful.

This experience has compromised my trust in Coinbase, and I am compelled to escalate the issue through a chargeback process due to the lack of support and transparency.

It turned out that PayPal (which works well with all my other merchants) actually declined those transactions, HOWEVER I was never notified of that issues and Coinbase DOESN’T HAVE THAT FEATURE to notify its customers is a transaction failed. After an hour and providing the supervisor with info and feedback I got no “thank you” for helping them uncover a real issue with the app and no compensation for any of my transactions which were apparently denied but never reported to me.

I’m not a serious or experienced trader, so this app is perfect for me. My only complaint would be that the fees seem a little high when you make multiple transactions and the undercutting of the price to allow for market fluctuations always seems to be more extreme than necessary, but if you take that into account as you make your sell orders, it all kind of evens out. This app is more ideal for HODLing, but I make some trades here and there as things go up and down. I’ve tried other apps and didn’t like the UI or just didn’t trust them.

I deposited $3k through ACH from my bank on Feb 9th, 2021. Zero balance shown in Coinbase and Coinbase Pro ever since. Oddly, my account history in Coinbase reflects a $3k USD transfer to Coinbase Pro (which I didn’t initiate) but such transfer does not exist in my Coinbase Pro account.

I understand the heavy interest in crypto has bogged down support, which I have sympathy for. Expecting customers to sit on their hands for 30+ days without any response is unethical and morally demeaning. 

If you are reading this review to see if you should be downloading the Coinbase app, please do not do it. Look elsewhere.

The crypto industry is still emerging. Coinbase should follow the customer priority model of Gemini. When I had a customer support issue with Gemini’s new app back in 2018, not only did I get quick 2hr email response detailing the probable cause but I also received a conference call minutes later from the dev team inquiring the steps leading up to the issue so it didn’t happen to anyone else.

coinbase,ios,11thzone,5,2021-06-02 11:53:54,"PROS:
Gives easy access to cryptocurrency trading. 
“Instant” deposits. (More on this below.)
App is user friendly and simple. 

CONS:
Gives easy access to cryptocurrency trading. 
Instant deposits allow purchases, positive cash flow is needed for high frequency trading. (Duh)
App is way too simple. Even Pro is too limited. We need far more functionality and features. Tracking data of trades etc etc. Charts need improvement. Other Apps should not rival a Billion dollar company in tracking cryptocurrency. You need better CS. Use TDA as your model, not RbnHd.
It should be more clear when funds have cleared the bank, and when cryptocurrency becomes transferable. The Portfolio should only have assets managed in list form. A ”Coin List” can show all coins available, tradable, etc, and a Watchlist are in dire need of inclusion. I also don’t understand the multiple app approach. Account privilege status should be set up in an account hierarchy that grants access to higher levels within the App, not split up into separate Apps. 

Over all great experience so far. Reliable yet limited, but does what it does well. Let your deposits clear before you transfer coin. Know the limitations and pray for updates. Still recommended highly even though this review may sound super critical. That is not the intention. Will upgrade review and star level when shown improvement.",positive

I needed to make I needed make a withdrawal and send 1,200 dollars worth of assets to Nexo in order to leverage a loan. And as you would expect, the delayed it 72 hours for security purposes. That was frustrating. But then again they give you the option to accelerate your request with photo verification.... Well, even if you’re already verified, you need to verify it AGAIN just for that single request! What kind of BS is that? Well it gets worse. No matter how many times you put in your documents, it skips over the selfie option and automatically fails your attempt. 

No matter what I do, how many times I try, they fail my attempts. Fine. Fine! So after that I canceled my larger request and went with a much smaller 400 dollar withdrawal to another address.

Tell me, what is the point of a digital economy if the platforms we trust to facilitate payments is as slow as central banking?

Anyone who has tried to sell Bitcoin in the past will tell you, selling the coins was not only overwhelming, but also difficult. Coinbase has changed all that. I have sold coins with both the website and the app, and surprisingly, the iPhone app is actually easier use and offers a better user experience.

This exposes end users to the potential loss of their crypto-currencies, while believing they are ""secure"". As a better form of security, Coinbase should add support for both hardware (yubikey etc.) and software authenticator apps to better secure users' crypto assets. In the meantime, users should use all, or a combination of the following: Use a UNIQUE/strong password for this application (ideally generated by a password manager) that is used nowhere else.

I would also recommend Fidelity, but understand that Fidelity does not have long-term existing sales and purchasing request whereas, with Coinbase, you can set up permanent purchasing, and sales limit order incentives for your accounting needs.",positive
coinbase,ios,BHDArmy,1,2019-01-11 17:34:04,"Be very wary before signing up with this service. I sold some bitcoin and during the process of trying to deposit the cash from the sale into my account, I accidentally made a deposit into my coinbase cash account from my bank account (hit the wrong button). I tried to rectify my mistake by transferring the whole amount back to my bank account, but it would only let me do half. I assumed it was so they had time for the funds to transfer from my bank to theirs so I waited a couple of business days and tried again. No luck. So now it has been 11 days and they still won’t release the funds so I can transfer it back to my bank account. I have no idea why they need to hold my money this long. I am sure it has long been deposited into their account because my account was debited 11 days ago. I am very frustrated that they are preventing me from getting money back that belongs to me. I wrote their CS department on about 5 separate occasions and get the same run around each time. I wanted to give them a chance to make things right before going this route. Be very wary before using this company.

coinbase,ios,Kevin_NYC resident,1,2020-12-08 16:23:00,If you want to entrust investing in an crypto app that has absolutely zero support when issues go wrong then Coinbase is the place to go. Since the world of investing in crypto is new there can be growing pains. I mistakingly sent a transaction to an email address instead of a wallet and attempts to get corrected are abysmal. The FAQ’s say if a mistake was made wait 30 days for a reversal and if still not rectified contact support. There’s the rub...You have to email support and finding the right tree structure for this type of problem was difficult. Post submitting my email I got a resolution reply from Coinbase noting my ticket was closed. 2 more attempts to get corrected through this email channel available all resulted in the same automatic closing of my ticket. I assume they auto close without a human ever even reading and reaching out to me to resolve. No way to resolve my issue and if you try to call the posted 888 number they only will let you speak to a live person if you think you have a security breach. The regulators hopefully will review their practices but until they evolve stay away.,positive

It’s been weeks, I still am locked out with no answers. I’ve submitted an official complaint via the Coinbase website but still haven’t heard anything. I even reached out to u/coinbasesupport via Reddit, they didn’t respond to me either. Zero stars simply because of customer service. I have a big bag of crypto sitting on a locked Coinbase account, with no one to talk with or contact about it. It’s sickening. I have zero control of what’s going on. I plan to take legal action if they continue to ignore my official complaint since there is a time frame that they are obliged to respond by. Seems like they are overwhelmed with support cases and have no way to actually get to all of them.

I am 100% positive that I never initiated that amount. It took about two weeks for the amount to become available so I could transfer it back to my bank. That was strange and I guess it will remain mystery. Secondly, it doesn’t show clear (or not at all actually) how much we are in gain or loss for each crypto we own. Also, when we go to “profile” page, it shows cryptos that we don’t own. It’s just disappointing all around.

Considering the cost of etherium and popularity on defi coins i can only imagine how many inquiries you get from your customers as to why they can’t swap $2300 worth of assets or why $150 was burned in etherium for a $85 swap.

coinbase,ios,Sorce of corse,2,2020-04-20 08:19:01,"I’ve been using Coinbase for over a month and have made a number of trades.  Reading some of the reviews prompted this one.  Where exactly is all the money from the high fees going if the company hasn’t even bothered setting up a proper customer service channel??

What I can comment on is the high fees for sub par service.  Because I am wondering what exactly those fees are paying for.  The charts and info available are very limited and the prices when you go to buy, sell, and I’m wanting to say even convert raises an eyebrow on occasion.

I’ve written to customer support, but they referred me to a help article, which provided basic instructions on submitting an ID. Clearly, submitting an ID is not an issue, when your stupid system doesn’t recognize it. What’s annoying, it took Coinbase about a week to come back to me with this canned response; you would think one week would be enough to come up with a personalized response with details as to why the system can’t recognize my ID.

coinbase,ios,Austxxn,4,2021-12-24 05:25:14,"As a new user of Coinbase I was really excited to see the vast number of cryptocurrencies available on the platform. Right away I began trading and everything was very easy to navigate. The platform is visually pleasing, easy to use and get started, and also offers a wide selection of coins to trade from. 

My only complaint is that there is no (easy) way to see how much I’ve gained or lost since the time of purchase. What I mean by this is that on other trading apps when you buy a coin/stock you are able to immediately see how much the value has increased or decreased which gives you a good indication of when to sell and how to track gains and losses. 

Unless I am mistaken, the Coinbase app doesn’t offer this feature. You can see the current price of the asset and how much it has gone up within a specific time frame and your current balance in local currency as well as the conversion amount (e.g. 
         $512
          0.01 BTC
)

I would really like to see Coinbase add another drop down option on the “Your Assets” page that shows exactly how much the value of each asset has changed since the original purchase as well as its current value. 

(E.g.
 
Bitcoin           $50,000   <— current price
                     +$1,000     <— change in value since time of purchase

I wanted to buy Solana and Robinhood did not offer it so I went to Coinbase.   I then thought I would use this app and company to handle my crypto trades.  They charge high fees when buying and converting cash to crypto or crypto to cash. Also if you trade one crypto for another they ding you too even though they advertise they don’t charge for exchanging crypto. Seems to me they are basically like some of the big banks just interested in making money charging you for fees for everything. Things are not very transparent either.  For example trying to calculate your gains and losses is not possible on the app. You have to track your purchase price vs the market prices. Robinhood makes this very easy so it can be done but feels like Coinbase just wants to keep you in the dark on whether you are making money or losing your shirt.

They charge approx a 1% spread so your underwater as soon as you make your trade, then they charge you approx a 2% upfront fee. So for example, let’s say you feel a coin is going to pump. If you buy the coin 3% in spread and fees, the. You sell the coin 3% in spread and fees and God forbid you buy it back 3% in spread and fees. So you’d be out 9% in that scenario.

For example in Robinhood - it tells you how much you have made or lost each day on your investment and it tells you how much in total you have lost or made on that invest since your first transaction. You can create separate lists just for your investments in Robinhood. The transactions take FOREVER to finalize- which is really insane since this is supposedly based off a blockchain and it should be instantaneous! You get notified days and days later that a transaction has finally gone through when you thought it had days beforehand. It appeared that it had because the money was “available” but apparently technically it wasn’t yet. They just fronted you the money. It becomes very confusing when you are a moderate to heavy trader.

Coinbase is very user friendly. Especially for GenX. While it took some time to learn how to use it, CoinBase offered “free” cyrpto as an incentive.

A couple of things I want to note. 
Coinbase is compliant with all state and federal regulations, and keep a track record for your CPA. 
Coinbase offers incentives to hold your money by staking tokens such as Solana, Ethereum, and even USDC, and the APR is much better than any bank I know of currently operating in the US.

My last email contact with them was 12/26 and they said my case was in review, which is what I’ve been told for nearly two months now.  Nobody can explain what’s being “reviewed” and why it’s taking so long.  Meanwhile, my $8k I needed to send for payment is now $6200.  I cashed out per their customer service rep’s advice and they won’t allow me to put the money back in my bank account.  So it’s sitting there with no opportunity for gain/loss.  The company won’t return my emails, the company won’t unrestricted my account, the company has my money.  Next step attorney?

coinbase,ios,Rennok2382,5,2024-04-14 22:20:26,"I’ve been using coinbase since 2020

I’ve heard people say that CB has “outages” at key moments and people have missed out on great trades. I don’t know if that’s happened or not, but if it has, it’s never negatively impacted me. So 🤷‍♂️

Coinbase has been solid for me. I have access to most of what I want to trade, and there’s plenty of ultra fast tokens here to buy and send off to a wallet for swaps. 

I use xlm because it’s accepted everywhere, super fast, has ultra low fees, and is practically a stable coin at $.10! So it feels like a good bang for your buck right off the bat! Just don’t buy into a peak and hold into a valley. You’ll see

Tips:

Don’t store the bulk of your crypto on any exchange. Not your keys, not your crypto is real

Figure out what you want, what wallets support it, and do the research on a good cold storage setup

Factory direct is the only “safe” way to purchase a cold storage wallet. Inspect all packaging and devices for any irregularities. If sus, arrange a return/exchange

Find a good hot wallet (internet wallet) and keep a small/medium bag there for quick trades, purchases, and cash outs

Follow your wallets, exchanges, crypto projects, regulatory agencies, & current heads of state/agency on social media

Check your bags often

I have been fighting with them for several months to close my account and transfer my money back to my personal bank without success!!

Coinbase has a division called Know You Customer which starts asking for proof of where you get the funds from, they request payment slips, income statements, retirement income etc, etc and never stop asking for more, in the meantime they restrict your account and all you can do is see your balance,  with a pop up sign stating that your money is “safe in Coinbase”.  I have been requesting them to close my account and transfer my money back but all they reply is “your account is under review”.

The requirement to upload identification is not only invasive but also highlights their lack of concern for safeguarding personal information. 

To make matters worse, the identification method they have in place doesn't even work properly. After spending a significant amount of time trying to comply with their demands, it's clear that this is nothing but a waste of time. It's frustrating to see that Coinbase seems completely indifferent to the inconvenience and potential risks they're subjecting their users to.

It's disheartening that a platform dealing with financial transactions and sensitive data isn't taking the necessary steps to ensure a secure environment. Given the increasing importance of online privacy, Coinbase's cavalier attitude towards user data is simply unacceptable.

On the business level: small hiccups with ID verification, terrible support for customers that change their country, inexistent customer service and high fees for trading.
On the app level: the UI seems to deteriorate over time. Whereas back when coinbase would only support 2/3 cryptos it was easy to see their trends and easy to see where the market is going, now all the relevant information is hidden behind a bunch of clicks. An attempt to mimic Robinhood with some information about the coin and news also takes up room from what could be potentially more interesting info.

From focusing on democraticizing crypto Coinbase has moved onto a get rich quick investing platform at detriment of their customers. Unfortunately people still have to use it because of lack of decent competition, but I‘m sure this will change soon if they continue to ignore their users.",positive

I've been using Coinbase since February of 2021. The hidden fees were a trip trying to figure out around that time. Yes I'm glad you all decided to show how much it'll be for the network fee. I'm not a fan of the other hidden fee that most people who are just starting out may not even know about. Coinbase should state how much it'll be to transfer one crypto to the other before hitting the submit button. 

I've also seen a lot of great changes but some changes were making me think someone must have been really toasted while programming. 

For those out there who should know, try to not use your real cell phone number. Years ago it was about hiding your ss number. Now it's about your phone number. Use something like MySudo and use that free number only for this platform. 
I read through the comments and see people say they've been getting hack while having such and such amount of dollars. Do you really trust this company with that amount of money? Look into cold storage wallets and hodl on those.

-2017: 2/10 Single Sign On alone was hard, toggling airplane mode was commonly a ""fix"" for laggy transactions 

-2024 Custodial wallet features: 6/10. Good support for normal use cases. Poor support for things like multiple addresses per coin/network.  Also wallet only competitors for the mess that is  bridging coins vs swapong, but this was -never it's core use case

coinbase,ios,Blackford32,1,2020-04-06 22:30:35,"Downloaded this app through a recommendation from a friend and it’s truly terrible. Impossible to verify your bank account because it has an error every 5 seconds. Asked me to verify my license by sending a picture, which I did, and it came back with an error. Unable to verify my bank account by my account number and routing number, which are correct, but instead it just gives me error messages. Now I have money in here that I can deposit back into my bank account. They had no problem verifying my identity and my bank account when I was depositing money, but now that I want to withdraw there are all kinds of hoops to jump through that the app can’t even process. I don’t think I’ve ever actually left a review on the App Store until now, that’s how much this app has angered me. Developers need to figure it out. And until they do, you need to use a different service instead. I switched all of my stuff over to CashApp and it works much better than this garbage. I’d give it 0 stars if I could. Seriously just don’t download this app.",negative
coinbase,ios,Derek737,5,2020-01-05 01:20:29,"Great and easy to use app for trading any type of crypto. Definitely seems to be one of the more popular versions as well for good reason. Although I would lower the fees a bit. Even if other apps charge high fees as well, it would be nice if they take the route that other investment banks have taken lately to offer zero to very low fees for trades. Another piece of constructive criticism I must give though would be for the app to better explain in detail what your net gain is compared to the amount of money you have invested. That way your not just looking at a broad percentage between all your currencies or having to sit and do the math yourself based on how much I’ve invested verses it’s current value of each individual one. Other then that it’s great! 👍 and I highly recommend for anyone interested in trading bitcoin or any other crypto.",positive
coinbase,ios,RMS1983,4,2021-05-16 13:33:46,I’ve been using this app for 2 months. I like the learning about crypto when being gifted by Coinbase. As the information about the new coins or some projects are very interesting to learn about. If the developers would add a night mode and better tracking charts or options to see red and green candles or live graphs. I would give this app a 5 star rating. They continue to list more  coins. I just can’t see all coins listed when I type some alt coins in. Also some coins aren’t tradable. I do like the coins listed. But coinbase seems to have a limit of value. They don’t list anything lower than .12. Please just do the community a favor add night mode and better charts. Also CoinTracker linking is very useful. They do charge fees and I find them fair for the amount I buy.,positive
coinbase,ios,casual coun guy,2,2021-01-25 02:49:03,"Its an easy to use app but there are a few issues that have made me not like this app as much as I did at first.

First and foremost is while monitoring ETH I “traded” at 1395, selling 5 ETH for USD. On the sales report it said the trade price was $1381 A 14$ DIFFERENCE! I sit there and refresh the price constantly, and it hadn’t been $1381 for at least 5 minutes. So getting jilted out of $14 x 5 coins plus their high fees ate up almost 20% of my trade. Thats after fees just to buy coins too. Not very impressed and kind of sketchy if you ask me. 

Next is an interface issue. When you want to put your USD$ back into your linked bank acct you have to select the “withdraw” option instead of the “deposit” option. You are withdrawing the cash from the app acct back into your bank acct and a deposit pulls money out of your bank and deposits it into your app acct. This unclear wording made me nearly overdraw and even worse, since it takes my bank a few days to process the transaction (both withdraw and deposit), I had no access to my money for over a week which was frustrating. 

Another issue is the fees themselves. Very high if you’re trying to do times trades. 

Last issue off the top of my head is the lack of Monero trading. 

Its a good app for beginners who just want to learn I suppose but I’m a bit disappointed in the discrepancy between my sale trade price and their reported sale trade price which seemed dishonest.",positive

However, my main issue with Coinbase is their overly compliant stance with U.S. regulators. While compliance is necessary, it would be great to see them push back a little instead of rolling over every time new regulations come up.

If there were an option to give this app less than one star, I would absolutely choose it. I have wasted more than two weeks waiting for account verification, despite what the FAQ and support articles say. They claim the process should take up to 24 hours, when I reached out to support, they told me it would take 72 hours. After following up again, they said it could take up to a week!!!  And yet, well past the week-long deadline and yet no response.
Support team will not give you clear answers – they will give different timeframe to get you off the line. They are misleading potential customers with false promises just to keep them on the hook! Is the verification process supposed to take 24 hours, 72 hours, a week, or a month,?! they do not have a definite answer they simply lie straight to your face? Pick a timeframe and stick to it!
Engaging with support is an absolute waste of time. It is even worse than talking to their bot—you get nothing but scripted, meaningless responses with zero help.
I have been using other trading apps; this is by far the worst trading app out there. Imagine if your money was at stake and you needed help, only to be ignored by a team that clearly does not care.

Not only they charge 3 times more for simple usdt transfer, but also require you to pay fee in the eco system token, which you need to swap too. But that also has a minimum.

For example to send 200 USDT to another exchange you need to 3.25$ of Tron (trc20) token. But you only can change minimum 20$usdt, so you end up leaving 17$ on a exchange or paying another 3$ to move them.

When I place a limit order, I can see the price start to fluctuate as soon as I type an order that would be fulfilled in my favor. I have placed opposite sided trades on a second device and BOTH sides were SHORTED on a volume of maybe 100 coins of a sub dollar coin within 15 minutes. I have screen recorded trading showing how the app practically tracks my inputs since they also know my exact percentages and what it would take to wipe out a trade. The trading bot is also worthless. You pay more in GRID gains than you make no matter how you set it up, and the bots also contribute to the problem with futures. 

Stay away from this horrible trading app. You can only make money holding (unless they take your coin off the market then your holdings are gone too), which I also bet they use to manipulate prices when you’re not using.

Therefor you need to be able to trade. Kucoin has started crashing at very crucial times.

This has been a problem for me the whole time using Kucoin. Lost tens of thousands because of this and their “random” log out event that occurs when market tanks.

I got this app so I could trade XRP since most exchanges have suspended it. I had over $12k worth of XRP and was going to trade on margin. When I was in the process of trading, the app crashed and when I opened it back up, my account had a value of $0. All of my XRP that I had been saving for over a year had evaporated in thin air and I still don’t have an answer for what happened. All I know is that I had my XRP, then their faulty app crashed and I lost everything in my account. 

There’s nothing I can do to get back what was stolen from me but hopefully, I can help others by warning them to prevent them from having everything stolen from them.",positive

(Speaking of USDT when I was referred as a new user, I tried to get the sign up bonus but their wording is/was purposely confusing.   I say purposely because I pointed out the grammatical errors and they just ignored me)

Anyway… yeah at first I was having to pay exorbitant fees to load USDT via 3rd party, then they finally verified me and it was 1.02 which was nice.

Then, out of the blue, I go to load $200 via same payment source as before, at same internet IP I always use, and it says “for your safety your trade has been canceled”.  I ask support and they say try a new bank card.   Grrr.   Went to my bank and got a new card.  And voila!! It still does the same thing.   And here I am 2 weeks and several closed tickets later.    

I’ve transferred most of my assets over to my Ledger for the time being.    Proceed with caution and make sure you have an exit strategy.   I was worried they would freeze my funds “for my safety”.

Customer service only responds with generic emails as though I’m an inexperienced trader. However, this is completely the opposite of such.

Stop Losses will randomly disappear (they claim it’s from modified a Stop Loss.. then why did the new stop loss disappear as well?).

The biggest issue with their service is the manual close on KuMex. If you attempt a market close under critical conditions if a stop loss isn’t met or “changed” the market close MAY not work in order to sever losses and avoid a liquidation.

When you write in they can never see what happened and see send you info on how to trade futures. They don’t even check your record meaning they do v not have any sort of integrity.

GO READ THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS ‼️

They are not exaggerating.
I didn’t read the negatives until I joined Kucoin’s platform and started experiencing problems

The negative reviews tells it all.
My story is they robbed me.
My purchases either didn’t show up in my account and my money gone.

They are also involved in a case where they are being sued for scamming users and they are not regulated by the proper financial oversight organizations.

kucoin,ios,Mr.Penz,3,2020-06-15 16:17:39,"Hello,

I love the KuCoin application, it’s fast and the user interface is easy to learn and navigate. I like the fact that KuCoin makes it easy for me to pay for crypto with my debit card and the deposit is almost instant. However, I gave the mobile application a 3 star because it requires access to the photos stored on your phone to be able to buy crypto with fiat. This is a major turn off, there’s no reason for KuCoin to ask permissions to my photo album for me to buy crypto. I bypass this by going on their website using a PC, but it’s massively inconvenient. If they remove the need for the app to access my photo albums when trying to purchase crypto with my debit\credit card, I’ll update the rating to a 5 star.

Beat regards,

crypto.com,ios,Bobby de Ortega,5,2022-11-12 23:25:11,"Out of all the Crypto exchanges out there, this is the one that clearly stands out due to their professionalism and consistent high-quality experiences to include this app. Over the last few years I have done business with several Centralized Exchanges and this one happens to be my favorite due to their privacy practices, stable experiences and tight customer service. If ever I had a question related to my investments they were quick to answer. Not only that, they have taken proactive steps to ensuring secure practices. With all of that said I would also highly-recommend that anyone reading this review to also consider a “cold storage” solution if they want even more control and security over their investments. Also, seriously do your homework in this space as there is a lot to learn and—at times—peril. Inform yourself, take calculated risks (or don’t) and mitigate any unnecessary risk or lack of security that you can. This space is both promising and relatively new and will not go away by virtue of the follies of some of the less mature characters out there.

crypto.com,ios,crypto jj,1,2022-02-18 13:39:08,"This app started great, it has many good features like the airtime pay for cellphone service that you can use with the Crypto that your holding. The downfall happened to me recently after securing the account with 2fa. In the beginning of the account security it was great, transfer went smooth, but then there was a attack on CRYPTO last month that caused some disturbances resulting in a 2fa reset forcing certain users to apply this change. Since this was done for me already it didn’t bother me until I went to transfer funds to discover the 2fa was not accurate. This is where the problem started. I contacted customer service and the bot spat out a inaccurate solution resulting in me texting a random agent that request that I submit a video for “security” reasons. After providing said video, it was not good enough, so I have to change email address to “secure” the account. I thought it was over until I get another email saying “he he hee” we need another video of glycine hiding a ransom sign. Now the crypto card I have is frozen and this is still a ongoing issue.

Update: In order to Get back into the account I had to literally submit 8 MORE VIDEOS!!! Keep in mind that it’s in a UNSECURE EMAIL, which means your identity will be compromised by another party to be used without your knowledge. This is a Major concern of mine and with the current trend I’m not sure if I will be victimized by this FORCED “security” policy.

I contacted them, took screen shots,  let them know what was going on and that I was losing my profits by the second….  They responded saying it would be fixed later.  Not “let us trade it where you need it or anything of the sort”. They waited until it dropped all the way down to what I bought it at!  Then had the audacity to say, and I quote ”. Thanks for the reply. I totally understand, however, the issue was resolved and you were able to withdraw the funds.
If you have additional questions do not hesitate to get back to us.”   They basically said screw you the same way Robin Hood app does. Scams.   COINBASE and COINBASE PRO is the way to go.  DO NOT GET SCAMMED WHEN YOU SHOULD BE MAKING MONEY!  Again, do not use this app.  Buy rates are always off compared to the actual market and always in their favor.

crypto.com,ios,Sxmjdushsb,2,2025-01-21 12:16:39,"It’s astonishing how horrible the user interface is. My first thoughts along with others before me is the app is intentionally confusing. They don’t offer candle charts. Only a line chart. It’s fine if they dont offer any indicators at all but they literally don’t offer moving averages..they need a horizontal line on the chart to compare current price to past price. You cannot look at past price & current price at the same time since they take up the same space which makes me constantly think the current price is different than what it actually is. The worst thing to me besides no moving averages is (to my disbelief) THE CONSTANT POP UP ADS! This app is 90% ADS!! even when I disable them I’m still getting pop up ads telling me to bet my money on sports & etc.. WTH. Also I hate brokerage apps that are filled with more words than numbers. I literally hate this app & it gives me headaches & a given up heart knowing this is the app imma stick to because of their low fees. The web app is broken & doesn’t show price averages. The only good thing is their customer support section ironically enough. You can close it & open it up & continue conversations on your own time whenever you’d like which is awesome. If you just add a horizontal line, simple moving averages & stop the pop up ads I would have way less complaints about this app.",negative

Why are all my assets wiped off completely? Even if the markets fell off there would be a few Pennies in there. Transaction history wiped. I have emails proving buys of certain assets and confirmations. But for some reason that evidence doesn’t concern this company AT ALL. I cannot and will not ever recommend this platform.

The only issue and the biggest issue that I have is that when I try to make purchases with my debit card, it’s a hit and miss and more often than not It is a miss. When I try to make a purchase some of the times it will go through most of the times it doesn’t go through and the issue is not my bank it is the application. I tried to go through their customer service, but their best advice was to transfer money to the application. What if I don’t want to transfer money, I want to use my debit card so I can purchased the crypto as I go along. Also,If you have a customer that is telling you there’s an issue with a certain part of the application why not try to resolve the issue instead of telling them to not use that part of the application and do their purchases a different way. Overall, yes I do like the application, but I get frustrated very often with it because of the fact that I cannot make my purchases that easily.

I currently have the jade green card and I can say that I have already received my Netflix rebate so that works. I have not tried to withdraw my funds yet as I’m waiting on my money to transfer so I can test everything, however I have spend money with the virtual card and got my money back in cro that way as well.

Also, I have experienced one problem with my card info not displaying on one of my devices however the customer support has been great and they are working on it. If you find yourself with that problem, I would recommend trying a different device if possible. In the end customer support has been kind and respectful and if you take the time to understand the fees that this app should help you earn some serious cash.

I have been trying to withdraw my money from Crypto into my bank account. They use Plaid to connect to your financial institution. For some reason, Plaid throws an error message stating ‘Something went wrong. Please try again later’. This has been going on for a few days. Crypto support says the issue is with Plaid, and they can’t give me Plaid support contacts. When I got with Plaid, they say to contact Crypto. I have done all the troubleshooting steps Crypto told me to do, and still doesn’t work. But surprisingly, there’s absolutely no issues using Plaid to withdraw money from my bank account and sending it to Crypto. No error messages there.

I think it is shady that there’s a magic “premium” added to coins when BTC is rising, and this is a money grab in my opinion because that premium is not applied when you sell. For example, CRO was .1210 when I tried to buy, and after doing the math (which is not provided because they know it’s shady) my average cost was somewhere around .125. Not a huge difference but that is hard earned profit by this point. I have been trying to get my CRO card for weeks now and I have been told that the only way I can continue with my application is to provide a picture of my SSN card. This was due to me moving addresses multiple times in the past few years because I am a college student. It is very frustrating and the support, albeit responds in a timely manner, does not seem like they really want to get you to your end goal. With all that said, I still trade here and love checking in on my cryptos. Unfortunately, after my staking period WHICH IS DUMB BECAUSE I DID NOT EVEN RECEIVE A CARD is over I will be transferring my balance to coin base or some other more reliable system.",negative

Also it’s said buying at true cost, but the fees hidden on exchange from trading a coin. Was not easy to find costs ahead of time for me at least. It is easy on and off for through ACH with Chase bank, had trouble with 2 other smaller banks limited to 1k and 5k transfers, chase allows 25k, once I did a withdrawal and had no issue. They just now opened up US to use a separate program to exchange tokens ( coins), so should be less expensive fees in trading and remember you will pay transfer fees to other crypto wallets ( called gas fees), but the coins moved dictate the amount, due your research before trading to check tax consequences for each and every transaction, can be a nightmare!

It is near impossible to send crypto to a wrong wallet, it simplifies the “bridge” to the off exchange wallet functions, it make it easy to add and subtract fiat from bank to bank. It does a lot of different thing well. And with less restriction like daily limits and what not. A lot better than some of the other apps like coinbase and the like. Yes there is a learning curve so on a scale of 1-5, one being cash app simple of just see bitcoin buy bitcoin, to 5 being the full exchange with stop losses, shorts, leverage trading etc, this is a 3.

You can’t trust these guys because they don’t communicate ANY changes they’re going to make. Or if they do by chance, they’ll enact it days before the announced date just to throw everyone for a loop and screw them up that way. The only people who will try to convince you that CDC is still good are the people who invested more than they can afford to lose in CRO (their crypto).

Specifically, the average cost basis should provide users with an ongoing calculation that considers adjustments for purchases, sales, transfers, and crypto earnings, allowing them to see their average investment per share over time. The total cost basis would encompass all investment transactions, including fees, giving users a comprehensive view of their financial outlay.

Furthermore, the overall yearly, five/ten year, and total years performance metrics should reflect the percentage change in value since the initial investment, factoring in both realized and unrealized gains or losses. For example, for annual performance, we could provide a year-over-year analysis highlighting their investments' performance relative to benchmarks, helping users identify trends and make informed decisions.

For example: you buy a crypto for $1 on their app and you want to sell that crypto immediately. Now you can only sell that crypto for $0.90 but the chart and prices are still the same. They are scamming you. Pick a better app that has a lower spread ( i think Binance is much lower). In this same situation on another app you may buy something for $1.00 and will be able to sell it immediately for about $.97.

This app also doesn’t have bar charts, live data, and you can only see the buy + sell spread after purchase. Their unrealized gains are inaccurate and lead you to believe you are up more than you actually are (they don’t base it off the sell price). For example I had an unrealized gain of $40 on the chill guy stock (i only bought it for $50) and almost doubled my money on it. I went to sell (and didn’t realize the large spread) and after i confirmed my sell order I actually only had profited $11. So i stead of $90 i was lead to believe I only came away with $61.

The issue is that the app is almost unusable. If anyone says this app is easy, they were lucky or lying. Banks consider it a scam, so just getting past that is a pain, but even if you do the app has an extreme chance of just glitching. Then if you do manage to begin trading there can be serious delays of over a week making it difficult to make time sensitive decisions. Lastly is what i consider to be mild scamming regarding transfers. Transferring into the app was very easy... Transferring out after being disappointed was obviously set up to be difficult. Setting up transfers is extremely glitchy and made me have to write down addresses manually because the app would glitch every time i went to copy one. Also with minimum limits far higher than the ones set for transferring in, i literally couldn't take out what i put in.

I went to get a haircut expecting to get in and out and i ended up waiting another hour after my haircut because my payment wont transfer instantly. Time is Gold! And not to mention they use lingos that are so confusing in their App. I don’t know why i kept using this platform after close to 3 years of having this all the way back in the day when MCO was cool.

No app like that should have been allowed on Apple store.  This is criminal fraud!  Intent to commit fraud is a crime and using it to do so a crime.
Who is responsible to bring justice?  Yeah no one! So whatever money you put in here be prepared to login and see it disappear but not actually transact as a built in option they control.
The bug users reported they say was fixed. Well they now allow access and show totals that are accurate but individually block use for transactions. That’s fraud at its best.

Even if u transfer most of time it’s slow and especially when big market movements and u wanted to use ur debit card to make faster purchase. Now it’s not even showing debit card option.

I wanted to highlight the notifications issue that's annoying so much. For the cryptos you track when you receive notifications abt price changes it's totally incorrect for the time. Price u see in notification and what you see after you tap to open are totally different. Not just by a fraction but by so many percentages.

crypto.com,ios,theOtherWB,4,2021-09-03 02:49:48,I’m only giving four stars because you really need to do your homework to learn about prices. The coins themselves have different sale % that come off the top. Crypto itself has no fees for buying/a unless you’re using your debit/ccard. However you need to learn the sale percentages of the coins. The price reflected on the graph daily is not the actual price. That’s the buy price. What I do is use the Binance app for the real price so that I’m not ticked off when I sell and find it’s $20 to sell when actually they’re reasonable. Setting up a bank account requires specific banks. Make sure yours is on the list. Once you get the hang of the fiat wallet and your buy/sale percentages it really is a great up. Set all your financial stuff up and get your bank account squared away before you buy anything. Get secure with how to get your money back into your pocket. Easy to use. Highly recommended.,positive

crypto.com,ios,Jones G-Money,1,2020-12-30 11:11:57,"The spread is ridiculously wide; you’d end up losing 6 to 12 times the amount you would have paid for an average commission with other brokers per trade.  It doesn’t have Exchange, so you’re pretty much playing roulettes and hope your gains don’t end up getting spent on the spread when trading.  If the value of your coins drop in the middle of the night or when you’re away from your phone, good luck managing your losses.  The only possible way it could be useful is when you’re holding your coins long term, but then you’ll have to worry losing money on conversion and then fees transferring them out. I bet they make a ton of money with how wide the spread is and the difference in conversion. When you’re buying and selling, there are options to convert it to either CRO, USDM, or BTC.  I find the USDM to have smaller conversion difference but good luck with being consistent with choosing it. Those three options get shuffled all the time as if it is designed with the purpose of making you make mistake in choosing their own coin CRO.  The whole thing is sketchy.",positive

No kidsing? Just like the last 10 times, it’s in my account SUDDENLY, after I tell you I noticed it wasn’t in my account. 
THAT IS MORE THAN ENOUGH TO SCARE ME  OFF. What a shame. This app was promising for quite awhile. It’s the next FTX you’ve been warned!!!!**

This app was 5 starts easy, until the last 5-6 months. Lately I have had a problem with 75% of all my transactions. Although I was able to receive my crypto deposits eventually, it’s been very frustrating having to hit up support every time I deposit, because my transactions don’t show up otherwise! I’ll see them on the blockchain, confirmed, and not in my wallet. Now it’s also with withdrawal- hopefully this is a fluke thing- but I have had 2 withdrawals in last 2 days both not even initiated after 2 whole hours!

The market data is also not reliable by a long shot. The graphs never match the actual current prices, and is limited to only an 8 hour snap shot. No zooming in, or getting real time stats. They lure you in with free trades for a month, but after that there’s no way it’s worth paying this company to trade as they offer nothing credible to justify it. Their debit card options are based on their poorly earning in-house crypto that doesn’t hold much value at all. The kicker is that you have to stake a set amount of money to keep any rewards you would benefit from staking. Specially when you end up likely going broke keeping your money with them.

Not only this, but customer service will close your conversation while you are still waiting to be approved, forcing you to reach back out, be transferred to a specialist with no warning, only for them to reassure you while you wait months to access your funds.

If you for some reason decide to use this platform over another, you must realize you will be forced to transfer your funds to another platform if you would like to cash out, meaning you will be faced with additional fees that could have been avoided.

Basically you have to add up what you invested and then subtract that from the value of your investment to see what you’ve gained… not hard to do but other apps have easily showed your gains without having to do all that. Second would be a showing you your positions when you click on the coins from the Home Screen. Right now you have to goto your wallet to see where you’re at instead of just clicking the coin from the Load up page. Which you then need to add up yourself as stated above.

After again being asked to resubmit, I reached out to support who told me to check my spam folder. Yep, there’s the rejection, saying that I should ignore my nationality and instead use my country of residence. That’s annoying and two days wasted...

So, I submit different docs and get confirmation within a few minutes. Awesome! I generate a BTC deposit address and send over a small amount for testing. Ten minutes later, I get a notification of the pending deposit, saying the amount will be available once there are two confirmations - pretty standard. Well, there are now four confirmations and my deposit is still pending. For reference, a transaction I sent after this on CoinSwap has already been deposited, which means two separate series of confirmations have completed.

While some of their features are promising, their UI is misleading and backend functionality isn’t working as advertised. Hopefully I’ll be able to update this review with better news soon.

The app also doesn’t display your overall percentage up or down, or dollar value up or down, on a position. Additionally, there’s a glitch with the SHIB display where it’s not showing the original transaction conversion in dollars. The items mentioned above are some of the most essential, expected pieces of data one finds on all other brokerage apps, but one doesn’t find it here, even though it would be so easy for the developers to add - for some odd reason they just haven’t done it.

Recently however, I learned about their debit card program and it’s benefits so I figured I’d give them another go. What a horrible idea that was! 

I noticed upon completion of my application that it hadn’t let me submit an address for shipping the card so I contacted their support center only to start a long uphill battle that would last me an entire day and still remain unresolved. I wanted to change my address for shipping but they had claimed it’s too late and because the address they have on file isn’t valid they’re not going to send the card regardless. I had asked for a refund of my money and they say they’re still going to hold it even though they can’t hold up their end of the bargain!

After being left on read countless times, my questions denied being answered, submitting countless documents and photos I still couldn’t get them to send me a card. They left me on read for hours trying to complete a simple task. When I would ask for a manager I would be ignored every time.

It’s just a horrible experience and it’s unsafe for individuals to use.

I stay in military barracks and we receive our mail at a UPS store where I have a mailbox. I have received a debit card here and this is where I receive mail. Customer service is absolutely not willing to send the card anywhere but my physical address despite me informing them that it will not be delivered. Customer service has been overall unhelpful and the lack of an ability to speak to a person on the phone is frustrating. It’s odd that someone that really wants to give them their business is being stonewalled like this.

update in response to dev comments: there’s no need to contact someone via the app’s chat.

On top of that, if a coin spikes in price, the sell price doesn’t change.

“Exchange” won’t work, which means one cannot place limit buys/sells. 
All market buys are +1% in addition to the added cost on the platform as opposed to the actual market value.

I don’t know about everyone else, but I detest starting an investment at a loss. This is what will always happens here. 

The navigation through the app is extremely tedious. 

The graph interface is not much to write home about. No bars, 8hour is the minimum amount of time. No zoom, no volume changes. 
App will not tell you the cost per coin but the total of the purchase. This has the effect of hiding the added value they are placing on the coins with respect to the actual market value. I much prefer to see how much I’m purchasing each share/coin for. 

My recommendation is to wait until the kinks are worked out. 

I will increase my rating one the price per coin is adequately reflected in a transaction. 

I will further increase the rating once the app actually has limit sell/buy capabilities.

I was really looking forward to using my card I waited so long for, but it seems I shouldn’t have gotten my hopes up.

First off, topping up the card is a nightmare. It never should have launched in its current state. It requires that you wire money from your bank to another using checking and routing number (all US establishments charge a transfer fee which costs around $35 at most banks). So each time I’d want to top up my card, it’d cost $35.. not cool. 

Beyond that – as if that part isn’t enough to steer away 99% of potential users – there still isn’t a way to export a transaction summary for tax purposes. So if you do actually load the card and use it often, then you literally have to write out each transaction and deposit on your own. 

I can’t imagine there are many people out there actually using this right now.

They advertised a 20 USDT reward for completing identity verification, but after completing the process, no reward was credited. Instead, they introduced another promotion — deposit $100 and receive 10 USDT — which felt like a bait-and-switch tactic. If a company starts with false promotions to attract users, how can anyone trust them for long-term services?",negative
