Current CDC management has shown they are more inclined to run this enterprise as a corporation than a crypto project.

Amazon has shareholders, you buying enough shares can land you a seat at the board where you can voice your opinion that ""we should stick to selling books"".  
CRO is a token and not a share in CDC, comparing it to Amazon shares doesn't hold ground.  
With all that being said, the closest comparison we can have to something already on the market is Binance. This is also then important to your long term investment point.  
Binance was an exchange that started its own coin, then market, then card and a bunch of other products.  
CDC was primarily a crypto card with its own utility token that ventured (and forced its user base) in to its own exchange, wallet, nft marketplace, sports sponsorships, etc...
